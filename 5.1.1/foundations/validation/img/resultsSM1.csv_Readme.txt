NOTE: Multiple corner reflector files were downloaded from https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/calibration.pl by specifying different dates. Image's acquisition date was used to determine which corner reflector file to use. As such, same corner reflector might have different coordinates for different images.
