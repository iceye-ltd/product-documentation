We Look Forward to Serving You The Small SAR Revolution in Earth Imaging During the Middle Ages, if you wanted to understand the way the world worked you would consult your local religious leader. A Priest or Prophet would interpret the Word of God from beautifully written tomes that were transcribed by hand over many years. These books were ornate and so precious that they could not be widely distributed, and most people did not know how to read. In these years, the thoughts of nations were controlled by various religious and political leaders. Then everything changed. The Renaissance and Reformation spurred new ways of thinking, and their ideas were recorded in printed books that were produced at low cost and in great volumes. People learned to read for themselves and think for themselves. Information spread across the globe. Sometimes disruption can be good. Hundreds of years later, in 2012, a small team of students working in the Nanosatellite Group of Aalto University considered the sequestered world of earth observation. The team was bothered by the limitations of government satellite programs in the same way that Renaissance and Reformation advocates challenged the knowledge control of the Middle Ages. Satellite imagery has been mostly provided by massive, government-owned or government-sponsored, exquisite systems. Like the tomes of old, these are beautifully implemented and precious. But normal people rarely have access to their images, and even when they are available, they do not have the timeliness to support the quick decisions needed in this rapidly changing world. The Nanosatellite students thought that timely, always available fine-resolution imagery should become a part of everyday life in the 21st century in the same way that GPS became integrated to nearly all businesses in the last decade of the 20th century. The humanitarian applications of easily-accessible imagery would include earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, glacial flow, and numerous environmental indicators. But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change. Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking. In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters. The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection.

RPCs link image locations to ground locations via simple equations that enable rapid calculations. In addition to ease and speed, RPC coefficients have the further advantage of being sensor independent. The structure of the RPC equations is always the same. For this reason, RPC exploitation code does not have to change to accommodate different sensors. In fact, both optical and SAR sensors are modeled by the same RPC structure. Exploitation code that performs geolocation for images from optical sensors can actually be used to derive ground locations from the RPC data included with ICEYE complex and amplitude images. This process is now commonplace in most geospatial viewers (we recommend using QGIS 1 and it is freely available for analysts and software developers.) Info Image geolocation of any mono image, optical or SAR, requires that an elevation model be used during exploitation. This is true for the physics-based equations and RPCs. Single Look Complex (SLC) Product These are full-resolution, single-look images of the focused SAR signals. Scenes are stored in the satellite\u2019s native image acquisition geometry, which is the slant-range-by-azimuth imaging plane. As shown in the green surface in Figure ??, the pixels are aligned perpendicular to the sensor flight track (The pixels have zero-Doppler SAR coordinates}). They are spaced equidistant in azimuth and in slant range. Each pixel contains both amplitude and phase information as represented by a complex magnitude value with in-phase and quadrature components (I & Q). Figure 2: Slant range and ground range image geometry SLC products are suitable for applications that rely on phase information or require the full image resolution. Because SLC images are in the native sensor orientation, there are no radiometric artefacts induced by the spatial resampling applied to map projection images. The range-azimuth orientation also enables further geometric manipulation, like orthorectification. Ortho versions can be produced using both commercial and free software tools, such as the European\u2019s Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel Application Platform (ESA SNAP S1TBX 2 ). The SLC product is particularly useful for those analysts who require multiple collections with matching phase data for applications like Coherent Change Detection (CCD). SLC images are typically used by scientists and organisations with advanced SAR expertise, but complex images will become core products for numerous users once SAR applications become more user-friendly. Amplitude Image Note When mapping an image from the slant plane to the ground, the average elevation of the scene is applied to the ellipsoid used in the projection. These are viewable forms of SAR data used for analyst exploitation; the pixels have brightness values but no phase data. Amplitude images are multi-looked to reduce the salt-and-pepper effect of speckle. The images are also projected from the slant plane onto an ellipsoid model of the ground surface (See Figure 2). The resulting product has approximately square spatial resolution and equal pixel spacing. It also has reduced speckle, due to the multi-look processing. Figure 3 illustrates slant range and ground range projections of amplitude pixels. The pixel's dimensions are equal in range and azimuth in the ground projection on the right. As with SLC images, sensor-oriented amplitude images maintain the native sensor geometry of range and azimuth and no image rotation to a map coordinate system has been performed. This avoids interpolation artefacts and it supports image stacking for change detection applications and physics-based, rigorous geolocation. ICEYE images can be viewed using open standard GIS readers such as QGIS 1 . We do not orthorectify our amplitude images or project them to an ellipsoid-based map projection, but we provide information, which can be quickly applied by users to their ICEYE imagery using freeware software, available on the market. This lowers the cost to our customers and ensures that they are always aware of the provenance of the elevation data used to project the image pixels to the topographic surface. This software is described in our Imagery Product Format Specification Document 3 .

The ICEYE constellation is constantly evolving. We began 2021 with seven operating satellites and we\u2019ll finish the year with thirteen systems. There will be more than ten more units added in 2022. The ICEYE constellation is optimized for persistent monitoring: rapidly repeatable access of any location on Earth, with flexible tasking for very high resolution spots as well as wide area scans. Figure 1: ICEYE Generation 2 Satellite The following describes the current fleet and their orbital configuration. SAR Sensor Parameters The ICEYE sensors are X-band radars, each with an active phased array antenna and electronic beam steering. The innate mechanical agility of these low-mass satellites and their electronic steering enable fast and precise pointing of radar pulses to the ground. The satellites can also image to the right or left side of the satellite track. Technical parameters of the current sensors are listed in Table 1. SENSOR PARAMETER SPECIFICATION Carrier frequency 9.65 GHz (X-band) Antenna size 3.2 meters (along-track) x 0.4 meters PRF 2-10 kHz Look direction both LEFT and RIGHT Range Bandwidth 37.6-299 MHz Peak Radiated Power 3.2 kW Polarization VV Incidence angle range 15-35 (mode dependent) Mass 85 kg Communication [radar payload data downlink] X-band 140 Mbits/s Table 1: ICEYE Generation 2 satellite system parameters Orbits At present, the LTANs of the ICEYE constellation are not uniformly spaced. This means that the time to revisit a location on the equator varies over a period of days. The mean revisit rate at the equator is 20 hours and the mean time to access a location on the equator is 12 hours. At higher and lower latitudes, the rates are more frequent. Table 2 lists the orbital parameters of the current SAR instruments. Each satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit with 15 revolutions per day. Their ground track repeat cycles vary between 1 and 22 days, depending on the satellite. Each orbital plane is phased around the Earth with a different local time of the ascending node (LTAN). This means that the overall constellation can observe a location at different times of the day. This has an advantage over dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbits, in which the local time of collection is always close to sunrise or sunset. Orbit Parameters Nominal Altitude 560 to 580 km Orbit Parameters Value Inclination 97.7\\degree (sun-synchronous) Orbits / Day 15 Ground track repeat 1 - 22 days Constellation mean revisit at equator 20 hours Constellation mean time to access at equator 12 hours Nodal crossing (LTAN) 22:30, 15:05, 14:04, 21:36 Satellite Catalog Numbers 43800,44390,46497,46496,47510,47506 Orbit maintenance Ion Propulsion Table 2: Constellation Parameters Each satellite has the ability to slowly adjust their orbits throughout their operating life. Adjustment is usually performed in the orbital plane by raising or lowering the satellite's altitude. This changes the orbital period, which in turn changes the ground track repeat period. Over the next 12 months, the fleet will gradually be adjusted into one-day repeating coherent ground tracks. This provides novel opportunities to combine data collections of the same area whilst maintaining rapid access times. The location of each ICEYE satellite is publicly available. The current configuration of the constellation can be found using the satellite catalog numbers in Table 2 and one of the excellent online orbital elements tools such as celestrak 1 or n2yo 2 , which provides a live view of the current ICEYE constellation.

Orbit Parameters Nominal Altitude 560 to 580 km Orbit Parameters Value Inclination 97.7\\degree (sun-synchronous) Orbits / Day 15 Ground track repeat 1 - 22 days Constellation mean revisit at equator 20 hours Constellation mean time to access at equator 12 hours Nodal crossing (LTAN) 22:30, 15:05, 14:04, 21:36 Satellite Catalog Numbers 43800,44390,46497,46496,47510,47506 Orbit maintenance Ion Propulsion Table 2: Constellation Parameters Each satellite has the ability to slowly adjust their orbits throughout their operating life. Adjustment is usually performed in the orbital plane by raising or lowering the satellite's altitude. This changes the orbital period, which in turn changes the ground track repeat period. Over the next 12 months, the fleet will gradually be adjusted into one-day repeating coherent ground tracks. This provides novel opportunities to combine data collections of the same area whilst maintaining rapid access times. The location of each ICEYE satellite is publicly available. The current configuration of the constellation can be found using the satellite catalog numbers in Table 2 and one of the excellent online orbital elements tools such as celestrak 1 or n2yo 2 , which provides a live view of the current ICEYE constellation.","title":"Orbits"},{"location":"productguide/fleet/#references","text":"T.S.

This section describes the tasking process for new ICEYE collections and how to order archived imagery from ICEYE\u2019s catalog. ICEYE Tasking To make things easier for customers we have a simple tasking process for new images based on standard imaging configurations and simple time windows ( Standard Orders ). This provides the quickest and simplest way to order SAR imagery. More sophisticated requests can be placed using a Custom Order . Standard Orders ICEYE Tasking Standard Orders are based on the concept of acquisition time windows . When placing an order, the customer specifies a list of timing requirements that define one or more time windows in which the desired images should be acquired. This allows ICEYE to confirm that the images will be acquired during the specified time windows, without the need for the customer to review a preliminary feasibility study with exact acquisition times. Figure 4: Example of a single image order with an acquisition time window of 2 days. This order specifies that the image should be collected anytime between 4-October-2021 00:00 and 6-October-2021 00:00 Figure 5: Example of an order for a stack of images with a repeat cycle of 20 days and an acquisition time window for each image of 14 days. Standard orders are submitted via email. To order, please fill out the Standard Order Form with your contact information, and be sure to specify all the required tasking options described in the paragraphs below. Once completed, please send your Standard Order Form and the optional AOI file to the email address customer@iceye.com . Info The order form will be provided by COSP. If you need a new one please email customer@iceye.com Figure 6: Standard ICEYE Tasking order flow The named recipients for that order will be notified via email once the order is received by the ICEYE Customer Operations and Satellite Planning (COSP) team. Once received, your order will be ingested into the ICEYE's planning system which will determine if the order can be confirmed within the AOI, and time windows that you have requested for the AOI. If the order can be fulfilled, you will be notified via email that your order has been accepted and the images will be scheduled for acquisition. If the order cannot be fulfilled in time, you will be notified via email that your order cannot be completed. Please note that standard orders require no final confirmation from you. If your order is accepted, the images will be acquired and delivered to you. After an order is confirmed, ICEYE will make sure that your images are acquired, downlinked, processed, quality controlled and delivered to you. The exact acquisition times are determined by the acquisition time window size that you chose when placing your order. How to fill in a standard order form When placing a Standard Order you will need to specify and/or select from the following options available in the Imagery Order Form : AOI : The Area of Interest in the form of a latitude/longitude pair in the WGS 84 coordinate system. Alternatively, you can include a KML/KMZ, or geojson file as an attachment to your order. Timing information : Start and End time for the order : This is the time range in which the order is valid. Acquisition time windows size : Choose a time window size according to the precision that you require for each of the images that should be acquired. Basic: Each image is acquired within a 14-day time window from your specified order start time and repeat cycle .This time window size is ideal for non-time-critical monitoring applications that do not require precise acquisition times. Pro: Each image is acquired within a 2-day time window from your specified order start time and repeat cycle. This is our base level service, commonly used in applications that do not depend on exact acquisition times or geometries. Exact: Each image is acquired within a 2-hour time window from your specified order start time and repeat cycle. This is our premium service, tailored for time-critical collections that do not depend on the customer requiring a precise imaging geometry. Note that for Exact time window size, you can optionally include an attachment with your desired exact acquisition times. This attachment can be the result of a feasibility study that you had previously requested or it can be generated directly by you using our published satellite ephemerides. Please see the section Optional Feasibility Studies below. Repeat cycle : This is the time between the start of consecutive acquisition time windows. This information is only required for orders of image stacks (repeat acquisitions). Acquisition type : Select whether you want a Single acquisition of the specified AOI Stack of images of the same AOI over a time period Imaging Mode : Refer to Section~\\ref{sec:TypesOfCollection} for more information on these imaging modes Strip Spot Scan Feasibility Study as Part of a Standard Order At any time, when considering placing an ICEYE Tasking standard order you can request a feasibility study by emailing customer@iceye.com . You will need to provide an AOI, an imaging mode (or resolution), a time period and any possible additional instructions that you may require. The ICEYE Customer Operations and Satellite Planning Team will respond with a list of acquisition opportunities. Please note that Feasibility Studies are for informational purposes and do not reserve constellation capacity for the opportunities reported. The required constellation capacity to fulfill an order under the agreed time window size is only reserved after ICEYE confirms an order . Please also note that feasibility studies are not required to place a standard order. You can eliminate the need for a feasibility study by accurately describing the time windows and other acquisition constraints that match your actual needs as part of your standard order. Figure 7: Feasibility studies can be requested before placing a standard order. Sometimes you might like to perform your own feasibility studies and we encourage this. We have made sure our satellite ephemeris information is publicly available at celestrak [^1] and n2yo.com [^2], and have provided step by step instructions on how to use the Swath Acquisition Viewer Software, SaVoir on the ICEYE website . Let us know how well this works for you. Custom Orders Custom Tasking orders offer a higher level of flexibility when specifying tasking requirements you desire. In general, any options that are not available as part of standard order can be requested as part of a custom order. Custom orders are initiated by submitting a Custom Order Form via email to customer@iceye.com . Our tasking experts will study the feasibility of your request and will quote an acquisition plan for you to approve. The following are examples of options that are currently available as part of a custom order: Mosaics : Coverage of large areas by acquiring multiple images Custom AOI coverage requirements : Each acquired image must cover at least a minimum percentage of the area of interest. Local time deviation limits : Images belonging to a stack or mosaic collection should be acquired within a certain local time range. Long image size requirements : Images that exceed the standard frame size of the requested imaging mode to cover the desired AOI. For example, long Strip acquisitions. Azimuth angle deviation limits for stacks or mosaics : Images belonging to a stack or mosaic collection should be acquired within a certain azimuth angle range. Custom acquisition time windows not available as standard tasking options : For example 72-hour, or 96-hour time windows for each acquisition. Our tasking experts will be happy to try to accommodate any special tasking request that is required to meet your business needs. Figure 8: Custom ICEYE Tasking order flow. Quality Control and Image Delivery The processed data will be assessed during the Quality Control process. An ICEYE image analyst will verify that the frame contains the customer\u2019s target location, that it complies to the product specifications and that it does not contain any disqualifying ambiguities. The frames are delivered to customers via a SFTP server within 8 hours of the data being acquired. ICEYE offers faster delivery times for customers that require near-realtime data. New customers receive instructions from the Customer Operations and Satellite Planning team on how to access your SFTP account. Through the SFTP server, you will have access to download all of your frames. You will receive a notification (via email) every time a new frame has been added to your SFTP account and is ready for you to download. Info Images are stored in your SFTP account for a period of 30 days. Unforeseen Circumstances In very rare situations, it might not be possible to acquire an image within the agreed time window. In this case, the Customer Operations and Satellite Planning team will immediately inform the customer and will propose an extended acquisition time window size or allow the customer to cancel the collection. ICEYE Archive Imagery As an ICEYE customer, you have access to a complete catalog of archive imagery that is available for ordering. This catalog is updated on a regular basis on your SFTP account. The catalog is available in kmz and geojson formats and it includes low resolution image thumbnails so you can get a feel for the content of the image. The archive catalog can be viewed in Google Earth, QGIS or your favorite GIS where you can browse image locations, filter by time or different image metadata and perform advanced searches. Please note that imagery is included in the ICEYE Archive Catalog at least seven days after its acquisition time. Figure 9: Browsing the ICEYE Archive catalog in Google Earth (kmz format). Figure 10: Browsing the ICEYE Archive catalog in QGIS (geojson format). Archive imagery orders can be submitted via email. To place an order, please fill out either the Standard Order Form or the Custom Order Form with your contact information, and include a list of the product names for the scenes that you wish to purchase. An example of a product name that identifies an image scene is : ICEYE_ARCHIVE_SM_10306_20190918T125047 Once an order is received, the ICEYE Customer Success team will deliver the requested images to you within 12 hours. Please note that all orders for archive imagery require no final confirmation from you. The images that you request in your order will be delivered to you. Figure 11: Archive imagery order flow. Please note that orders for archive imagery do not go through additional quality control. However, if you are not satisfied with the quality of an archive image that you have received, you can make use of our return policy described below. Order Cancellation In order to support your evolving business requirements, ICEYE supports a user-friendly order cancellation policy. Cancellation of Tasking Orders Standard Tasking orders confirmed by ICEYE can be cancelled free of charge up to 72 hours prior to the start of the acquisition time window. Custom Tasking orders may be cancelled or rescheduled within twenty four (24) hours after order confirmation at no cost, as long as the order is submitted at least 27 hours before the proposed data collection time.

Return Policy If you are not satisfied with your purchase, please contact our Customer Operations and Satellite Planning team at customer@iceye.com within 30 days of receiving your order. Your satisfaction is our priority, so we will work quickly to resolve your concerns. \u0153 Invoicing ICEYE users can pay for imaging in a range of different ways in order to be as flexible as possible: Prepayment : In this option a number of images can be paid for up-front. When the prepayment has been paid, you can place orders and receive the amount of data up to your prepaid quota. This is designed for customers that know that they would like to purchase a number of images and offers imagery at a reduced rate. Net 30 : This is designed for larger or industrial customers wishing to purchase imagery in volume. In this case we will discuss your needs and enter into a contract with you. Images can then be tasked as and when you see fit and we will invoice you monthly. Payment then has to be made within 30 days of sending you the invoice. ICEYE Finance will send invoices during the first week of the month for all the products delivered to the Customer within the previous month. The monthly invoice will not include the products that have been ordered but have not yet been delivered to the Customer. If no products have been shipped to the Customer during the previous month, invoice will not be extended.","title":"Ordering data"},{"location":"productguide/ordering/#ordering-iceye-products","text":"ICEYE offers timely and reliable global SAR imaging.

We do this with our continually growing SAR satellite constellation, currently in orbit and delivering SAR data. This product guide reviews our constellation, products, imaging modes and ordering process. This is a living document because our innovative small SARs are flexible and they welcome our routine upgrades to their resolution, coverage and quality. We\u2019ll release new versions of this guide as we improve our sensors, expand our constellation, and streamline our order and delivery systems. SAR sensors see through clouds and darkness. They measure pulse echoes with a precision much smaller than a single wavelength. Their resolution is independent of distance. They are capable of pristine geolocation, and they are change detection machines. We Look Forward to Serving You The Small SAR Revolution in Earth Imaging During the Middle Ages, if you wanted to understand the way the world worked you would consult your local religious leader. A Priest or Prophet would interpret the Word of God from beautifully written tomes that were transcribed by hand over many years. These books were ornate and so precious that they could not be widely distributed, and most people did not know how to read. In these years, the thoughts of nations were controlled by various religious and political leaders. Then everything changed. The Renaissance and Reformation spurred new ways of thinking, and their ideas were recorded in printed books that were produced at low cost and in great volumes. People learned to read for themselves and think for themselves. Information spread across the globe. Sometimes disruption can be good. Hundreds of years later, in 2012, a small team of students working in the Nanosatellite Group of Aalto University considered the sequestered world of earth observation. The team was bothered by the limitations of government satellite programs in the same way that Renaissance and Reformation advocates challenged the knowledge control of the Middle Ages. Satellite imagery has been mostly provided by massive, government-owned or government-sponsored, exquisite systems. Like the tomes of old, these are beautifully implemented and precious. But normal people rarely have access to their images, and even when they are available, they do not have the timeliness to support the quick decisions needed in this rapidly changing world. The Nanosatellite students thought that timely, always available fine-resolution imagery should become a part of everyday life in the 21st century in the same way that GPS became integrated to nearly all businesses in the last decade of the 20th century. The humanitarian applications of easily-accessible imagery would include earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, glacial flow, and numerous environmental indicators. But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change. Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking. In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters. The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection. We will bring our users access to highly accurate, highly reliable monitoring, whenever and wherever they need it, at a pace that has never before existed.

But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change. Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking. In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters. The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection. We will bring our users access to highly accurate, highly reliable monitoring, whenever and wherever they need it, at a pace that has never before existed.

There are two basic forms of ICEYE images: complex images in the slant plane and amplitude images projected to the ground surface. Details about the formats of these products are provided in 'Product Formats' . Complex Images SAR complex images contain pixels that have both amplitude and phase values. They are produced at full resolution and are projected in the inclined direction of illumination, called the slant plane. Since complex images retain phase information, they can be used to produce numerous SAR products like coherent change detection images and precise surface motion measurements. Amplitude Images These are the familiar SAR gray-scale images with amplitude-only pixels. They are \u201cmulti-looked\u201d to reduce the grainy effect of speckle, at the cost of slightly lower resolution. Amplitude images are projected to the ground surface and can be oriented with respect to the sensor or produced on an ellipsoid-based map projection. For historical reasons our amplitude images are associated with the acronym GRD which stands for Ground Range Detected . This term may change in the future to be something more meaningful. Types of SAR Collection Our first set of satellites operate in one of two primary imaging modes called Strip Mode and Spot Mode. These are available in both right and left-looking configurations. The design flexibility of our satellites allows their imaging modes to be continually evolved. We will be adding more modes, and more flexible illumination patterns, in future versions. A recent addition is the introduction of a wide area imaging capability that utilises electronic beam steering. This is called Scan Mode A summary of the imaging modes is listed in Appendix~\\ref{ch:modeCharacteristics}. Strip Mode In this mode the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses while the antenna beam is fixed in its orientation. The beam is pointed off to the side of the satellite at an angle broadside to the satellite flight path. This results in a long image strip parallel to the flight direction. ICEYE standard Strip products have a ground resolution of 3m in range and azimuth and cover an area of 30km (range) by 50km (azimuth). The strip length can be tailored up to a length of 500 km, in increments of 50 km. Spot Mode In Spot mode the radar beam is steered to illuminate a fixed point. This increases the illumination time and the length of the synthetic aperture, and it improves azimuth resolution. The standard Spot mode uses the maximum 300 MHz pulse bandwidth and it provides a 0.5m x 0.25m resolution complex image (slant range by azimuth). The final multi-looked amplitude image has 1m x 1m resolution on the ground. Scan Mode This mode uses the phased array antenna to create multiple beams in the elevation direction. This beam steering means that points on the ground are not illuminated for as long which reduces the resolution of a Scan product compared to Spot or Strip modes. Conventionally, ground points are illuminated by different parts of the radar beam resulting in brighter and darker regions in the image. We compensate for this by also steering the radar beam sideways during each burst of radar pulses resulting in an overall improvement in image quality. This technique is called Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS or TOPSAR 1 ). Our Scan product produces imagery that covers an area of 100km x 100km with a resolution better than 15m.
