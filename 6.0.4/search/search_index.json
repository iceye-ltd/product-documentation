A Priest or Prophet would interpret the Word of God from beautifully written tomes that were transcribed by hand over many years. These books were ornate and so precious that they could not be widely distributed, and most people did not know how to read. In these years, the thoughts of nations were controlled by various religious and political leaders.</p> <p>Then everything changed. The Renaissance and Reformation spurred new ways of thinking, and their ideas were recorded in printed books that were produced at low cost and in great volumes. People learned to read for themselves and think for themselves. Information spread across the globe.</p> <p>Sometimes disruption can be good. </p> <p>Hundreds of years later, in 2012, a small team of students working in the Nanosatellite Group of Aalto University considered the sequestered world of earth observation. The team was bothered by the limitations of government satellite programs in the same way that Renaissance and Reformation advocates challenged the knowledge control of the Middle Ages.</p> <p>Satellite imagery has been mostly provided by massive, government-owned or government-sponsored, exquisite systems. Like the tomes of old, these are beautifully implemented and precious. But normal people rarely have access to their images, and even when they are available, they do not have the timeliness to support the quick decisions needed in this rapidly changing world. </p> <p>The Nanosatellite students thought that timely, always available fine-resolution imagery should become a part of everyday life in the 21st century in the same way that GPS became integrated to nearly all businesses in the last decade of the 20th century. The humanitarian applications of easily-accessible imagery would include earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, glacial flow, and numerous environmental indicators. But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change.</p> <p>Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking.</p> <p>In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our  ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters.</p> <p>The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection.</p> <p>We will bring our users access to highly accurate, highly reliable monitoring, whenever and wherever they need it, at a pace that has never before existed.</p> <p>Welcome to the Earth Observation Renaissance !</p> <p>Read The ICEYE Story</p>"},{"location":"changes/","title":"Change Log","text":"Date Version Comment 11th Aug 2025 6.0.4 Addition of Scan Wide imaging mode 2nd Feb 2025 6.0.3 Addition of Spot Fine 1-look and Spot Fine 2-looks imaging mode variants 20th Jan 2025 6.0.2 Fixed broken table with information on cancellation policy 11th Oct 2024 6.0.1 Addition of Dwell Precise imaging mode 15th Sep 2024 6.0.0 Product Guide re-structured as Product Specification 12th Jul 2024 5.2.8 Updated fonts and colors to new ICEYE brand.

Each pixel pair of the image is referenced to the sensor by its range and azimuth coordinates. That is, each pair has a specific range to a sensor reference location and an azimuth location in the along-track direction. This range-azimuth geometry establishes an arc in space, which is the basis of the geolocation modeling of SAR images. The arc for each pixel is initially fit to the slant plant surface, and for amplitude images it is subsequently projected to a ground surface, such as the ground plane or ellipsoid or topographic surface. The geolocation accuracy of an image depends on how well that range-azimuth arc is measured. The relevant parameters for the arc are: the range and azimuth values, the sensor reference location, and the sensor velocity vector. We will consider each of them in turn.</p>"},{"location":"foundations/geospatialAccuracy/#range","title":"Range","text":"<p>A SAR system is able to measure the range to a point on the ground very precisely. The theoretical precision of range is a fraction of a wavelength. However, as the RADAR pulse propagates through the atmosphere, it undergoes diffraction which curves the path of the pulse. This adds an unintended increase to the range of an object. The amount of increase depends on the look angle, the location of the satellite and scene, and even the time of day. The ICEYE SAR processor applies path length corrections (typically on the order of a couple of metres) using well established models. </p>"},{"location":"foundations/geospatialAccuracy/#azimuth","title":"Azimuth","text":"<p>The sensor also compares pulses to measure how the range to a point changes as the satellite moves along its trajectory.

It is the viewable version of SAR pixels and thus contains only microwave brightness values and no phase data. As with the complex image, its pixels have a range-azimuth structure. The difference is that it is usually projected to a ground surface, not the slant plane. It must be emphasized that the SAR image on its own cannot provide accurate ground locations. The chosen ground projection surface is typically an ellipsoid with a height set to the average height of the imaged area. This means that latitude and longitude image corner coordinates are for reference only. They are intended to layout the image footprint, and since they were projected to a single-elevation surface they cannot be used for accurate geolocation. SAR geolocation requires the projection of the natural range-azimuth arc of each pixel to an actual terrain height. This means that the image exploitation system must have a ground terrain height model on hand and it must use the coded SAR geometry model equations. This situation is exactly the same for optical images. The imaging conversion of 3D space to any 2D image, optical or SAR, means that proper geolocation requires pixel projections to elevation models on exploitation workstations.</p>"},{"location":"foundations/geospatialAccuracy/#elevation-models","title":"Elevation Models","text":"<p>In the case of a calibrated SAR with accurate range-azimuth coordinates and precise orbit data, the most significant source of geospatial error comes from the way the data is measured and exploited on a workstation.

Both SAR and optical satellite sensors can provide accurate orbit information, but optical sensors also need to physically measure the pointing orientation of the sensor to the ground. These data are derived from on-board gyroscopes and star sensors, and errors in the estimates of the sensor pointing direction project along the huge distance to the ground surface. A SAR satellite must also estimate pointing direction in order to illuminate the proper location on the ground. But once the image is formed, the angle to the ground location is determined by the azimuth coordinate, which is itself derived from ultra-precise pulse-to-pulse phase changes. The aspect of optical geolocation which contributes the most uncertainty, pointing direction, is not a significant factor for SAR geolocation. A well-calibrated SAR with accurate orbits, in conjunction with precise elevation data, can provide a geolocation accuracy of less than one meter for well-defined points. This is the precision to which ICEYE aspires.</p>"},{"location":"foundations/geospatialAccuracy/#geospatial-metadata","title":"Geospatial Metadata","text":"<p>It is interesting to note that the ground projection issue relates to any oblique looking imaging system (such as optical sensors) that are able to take images off-nadir.

However, the actual implementation of this model is quite detailed and can include ponderous and slow iterative solutions. An engineering replacement to optical and SAR physics-based geometry models is commonly used to speed and simplify the calculation of ground locations. This replacement model takes the form of a ratio of polynomials that link a ground location (in latitude, longitude and height) to its associated image location. The replacement engineering model has been called Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPC), but at ICEYE we prefer to call it Rapid Positioning Capability. The latter term instantly indicates its purpose and value, rather than referencing its mathematical structure. Because it is merely a polynomial replacement, the RPC data structure provided for ICEYE SAR images is exactly the same as the RPC model for all optical images. RPC is not only fast and simple; it is also sensor- and phenomenology-independent.</p> <p>It should be noted that RPC data are derived from an image\u2019s geometric metadata and the physics-based geometry model for that sensor. They are usually calculated during image formation and included in the output image file. RPC coefficients are provided for ICEYE\u2019s amplitude images in the GRD format. The model is described in [ <sup>1</sup> ] which extends the work for the National Imagery Transmission Format (NITF)<sup>2</sup> to GeoTIFFs. The translation of latitude, longitude and height to image pixel coordinates is described below.</p> <p>The approximation used in ICEYE products is a set of rational polynomials that describe the normalized row and column values (\\(rn\\) , \\(cn\\)) as a function of normalized geodetic latitude, longitude, and height.

Each site consists of a set of calibration point targets such as trihedral corner reflectors. The position, orientation and size of these features are carefully measured and maintained, and they are often provided by organizations such as NASA JPL as a free service to the geospatial community. ICEYE engineers compare the target ground coordinates derived from the image coordinates and known elevation to the precisely surveyed ground-truth coordinates. These calibration comparisons provide a statistical measure of the horizontal accuracy of ICEYE images by comparing calibration point target locations in terrain corrected imagery to ground truth measurements of each calibration point target. The root, mean square error (RMSE) is then calculated from all the measured location errors. Currently the ICEYE fleet is achieving a worst-case RMSE of 6 m. In actual practice elevation models used during image exploitation have vertical uncertainties, and feature signatures are not as precise as those of corner reflectors.

One is based on the length of the synthetic aperture and the other is based on the signal bandwidth, and sometimes these are quite different in magnitude. It is common for azimuth resolution to be collected at a higher fidelity than range resolution. If a full-resolution image were produced from such data it would look compressed in range. To view the image in a more natural aspect we need to \u201csquare the pixels\u201d so that the range and azimuth scales are the same. </p> <p>Info</p> <p>Speckle is a grainy, noise-like feature of SAR images. It is caused by the coherent nature of SAR illumination. The reflections from small scatterers within a resolution cell combine constructively and destructively to brighten or darken the returns.</p> <p>This is done by manipulating the synthetic aperture into smaller sub-apertures and then combining them. The sub-apertures are called \u201clooks\u201d and they each produce an image with lower azimuth resolution. This may sound disappointing, but when these individual sub-aperture images are combined, they form a multi-look image in which the noisy effect of speckle is reduced.  Complex images are stored at full-resolution and are called single-look complex (SLC) images. Amplitude images are typically multi-looked in azimuth using two to 12 sub-apertures. If range resolution exceeds azimuth resolution a similar multi-look process can be applied in the range dimension.</p>"},{"location":"foundations/OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#sub-aperture-stack-or-video-image","title":"Sub-aperture Stack or Video Image","text":"<p>Suppose we take the aperture splitting further and create six or seven segments to produce multiple sub-aperture images. One advantage of this sub-aperture stack is that it can indicate glints that are bright in only a portion of the full aperture. This signature might be washed out on the full-resolution image by the bulk of the aperture in which there was no glinting, but it can be very noticeable in one of the low-resolution sub-apertures. Glints tend to be important signatures because they are usually caused by human-made features. We could even loop the stack like a short movie, or SAR video image, to look for such glints and moving objects.

Two or more images of the same site are collected at different times to detect scene changes. For ACD only the brightness values are compared, while CCD uses phase data.</p> <p>In order for change detection to work, the images have to be collected from nearly the same location in space with similar illumination geometries. For ACD the two images can be overlaid in the complementary colors (eg red and cyan). In this way, features with similar backscatters will be gray, but features with backscatters that changed during the imaging period will appear in one of the two colors. It is conventional for the first image to be displayed in red and the second in cyan. If something on the ground changes between the two collections you will see whichever color signature is dominant.</p> <p>A mnemonic is used to help interpret ACD products: \u201cRed is fled. Blue is new\u201d. That is, a red signature indicates a feature that was present on the first image but left the scene prior to the second image, and a blue signature indicates a feature that appears only on the second image. This mnemonic is an easy way to help remember the order of the images, but appreciate that the second image is actually cyan, not blue. The intentional sloppiness of the mnemonic is acceptable here because verbal precision would ruin the rhyme.</p> <p>In contrast to amplitude change detection, CCD compares the phase values of two nearly identical images taken at different times. CCD is far more sensitive to changes because it is based on phase differences rather than pixel brightness differences and, as we know, phase is measured to within a small fraction of a wavelength. The collection constraints to ensure image-to-image coherence are tighter for CCD than ACD.</p> <p>When the collection parameters are nearly identical, the phase values are also nearly identical, and any changes are due to backscatter differences at a scale of less than one wavelength. It is typical for CCD images to display pixels where phase is consistent in white and the pixels where the phase has changed are dark. These are areas where the two images have \u201cdecorrelated\u201d, or lost phase consistency, due to some subtle change in the scene.</p>"},{"location":"foundations/OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#other-multi-image-sar-products","title":"Other Multi-image SAR Products","text":"<p>The amplitude and phase data of SAR images can be combined to produce other useful products that are too numerous to describe in detail in this overview.

The image is built up via the forward motion of the antenna, one line at a time. The pulses are emitted at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which can range from a few hundred pulses each second for airborne systems to thousands each second for spacecraft. In the SLAR technique, the individual pulses create each image line. The angular width of the pulse on the ground along the direction of flight, or azimuth direction, determines one component of resolution. The range measurements are collected in the \u201cslant range\u201d direction, and range variations to different objects form the second dimension of resolution.</p> <p></p> Figure 5: Side-Looking Airborne Radar <p>SLAR was used the early days of radar imaging but it had serious limitations. Range resolution was one-half the length of the pulse in the range direction. Since the pulses are emitted at light speed, even a very brief pulse of one-millionth of a second would be 300 meters long and produce range resolution of 150 meters (Figure 6).</p> <p>Azimuth resolution was based on the angular width of the pulse in the azimuth direction (\\(\\beta\\)). Long antennas create narrow beams, but the beam spreads out from the antenna to the distant ground surface. Antennas cannot be made long enough to produce good azimuth resolution, and SLAR produced images with resolutions in the hundreds of meters, even from aircraft.

In this section we introduce a geolocation algorithm that we use to measure the geospatial accuracy of ICEYE imagery. </p> <p>The purpose of geolocation is to calculate the difference between an observed objects's location measured from SAR imagery and its actual, ground-truth, location. The true 'ground truth' location of an object can be specified in a geocentric rotating coordinate system such as ECEF (Earth-centred, Earth-fixed) as having the coordinate \\(R_o=[x_o,y_o,z_o]\\). The satellite's location in this same reference system changes with time and is given by \\(R_s(t)=[x_s(t),y_s(t),z_s(t)]\\) and has a velocity given by \\(V_s(t)=[v_{sx}(t),v_{sy}(t),v_{sz}(t)]\\). From these, the slant range from the satellite to the object as a function of time \\(s_r(t)\\) is given by (1):</p> \\[ s_r(t) = (x_s(t) - x_o)^2 + (y_s(t)-y_o)^2 + (z_s(t)-z_o)^2 \\qquad (1) \\] <p>As the satellite transits past the object, the phase of its radar response varies providing the object's signature with a characteristic spatial Doppler frequency shift given by (2):</p> \\[ f_D(t) = - \\frac{2}{\\lambda s_r(t)} (\\mathbf{R_s(t)} - \\mathbf{R_o}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{V_s(t)} - \\mathbf{V_o}) \\qquad (2) \\] <p>Geometrically, the objects position is found by calculating the intersection between a sphere of radius that corresponds to the range of the object (1), a cone defined by the Doppler frequency at a certain time (2) and the reference ellipsoid (see Fig. 1). There are two locations where all three parametric surface meet - one on the left side of the sensor and one on the right, which is why SAR systems only image on one side.</p> <p></p> Figure 1: The location of an object in a SAR image is defined by the intersection of a range-sphere, a Doppler-cone and a reflecting-surface. <p>To calculate the geolocation accuracy of a SAR image the following steps are performed :</p> <ol> <li>The first step is the selection of calibration objects, usually corner reflectors, each with a known geographical location. For this purpose both publicly available corner reflectors and ICEYE's own dedicated corner reflectors are used. The object position \\(R_o=[x_o, y_o, z_o]\\) is used in the following step to calculate the expected target position in range and azimuth \\((I_r,I_a)\\) in the image.</li> <li>The second step is to determine the location of the sensor as a function of time by using the orbital state vectors provided in the metadata of each image.  ICEYE orbital state vectors provide position and velocity every second which does not have the fidelity to accurately locate each azimuth location in the image and so the state vectors are interpolated.</li> <li>The expected range and azimuth position of the corner reflector \\((I_r,I_a)\\) is then calculated using Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The azimuth position of the object corresponds to the time of closest approach between the object and the sensor which is the instant that the Doppler frequency shift of the object observed from the sensor is zero. (By convention ICEYE SAR images are processed to the zero Doppler location/time). The expected range position is calculated using the distance \\(\\mathbf{R_s(t)}-\\mathbf{R_o}\\) when the Doppler shift is zero. ie:</li> </ol> \\[  - \\frac{2}{\\lambda s_r(t)} (\\mathbf{R_s(t)} - \\mathbf{R_o}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{V_s(t)} - \\mathbf{V_o}) = 0 \\qquad (3)  \\] <ol> <li>The measured range and azimuth position \\((M_r,M_a)\\) of the calibration object is calculated by oversampling the SAR image and fitting the expected two-dimensional imaging response function to the object and measuring the location of the peak.

Some product types are well suited for human exploitation whereas others are designed with algorithmic and signal processing systems in mind. ICEYE\u2019s data product offering can be used to fulfill a variety of use cases. The following distinctions are useful in order to understand ICEYE\u2019s data product offering:</p> <p>Complex vs Amplitude Data Products: SAR imaging datasets initially contain samples of in-phase and quadrature value pairs representing the measured radio wave backscatter. These value pairs can be converted computationally to amplitude and phase values. The data products that contain both amplitude and phase data are called Complex Data Products. However, for use cases where phase data is redundant the data can be stripped to reduce file size and increase convenience. Products with only amplitude data are called Amplitude Data Products. However, because of the lack of phase values, amplitude data products cannot be used for certain use cases such as interferometric SAR (InSAR) or coherent change detection (CCD).</p> <p>Standard vs Custom Data Products: The below subsections define all the Standard Data Products in ICEYE\u2019s offering. However, it may be possible to generate Custom Data Products to fulfill special customer requirements. Such custom products are available on demand as custom orders. These non-standard products are not guaranteed to adhere to the delivery timelines described in Section 3.7.3.</p> <p>Availability and Service Level: Most standard products are available on Standard Service Levels but some are only available On (special) Demand via Custom Orders at separately agreed (and thus custom) service levels despite being standard products. Refer to Sections 3.7.3 and 5.5 for more information. Additionally, customers with specific timeline requirements should consult ICEYE to discuss special needs. New customers are advised to reach out via the ICEYE website.</p> <p>Imaging Mode Support: Many data products can be generated from SAR collections acquired with any Imaging Mode (see Section 2). However, some imaging modes can be used to generate only a limited set of different data products and vice versa.</p> <p>While all of these distinctions could be used to group and present the data product offering, this Section 5.1 prioritizes the complex vs amplitude data products grouping in structuring an overview onto ICEYE\u2019s data product offering in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 but the availability and service level as well as imaging mode support differences are also clearly highlighted.</p>"},{"location":"productspecification/dataproducts/#511-amplitude-data-product-offering","title":"5.1.1 Amplitude Data Product Offering","text":"<p>The following four products make up ICEYE\u2019s Amplitude Data Product offering:</p> <p>The primary product within ICEYE's Amplitude Data Products offering is the Ground Range Detected (GRD) amplitude image data product.

It is usually lower than the Slant Range Resolution as it is the result of projecting the SAR data captured in the slant plane into the ground plane. Its two components are:</p> </li> <li> <p>Ground Range Resolution: The ability to distinguish two objects on the ground in the range direction, which is perpendicular to the radar's flight path. It depends on the bandwidth of the radar signal and the incidence angle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ground Azimuth Resolution: The ability to distinguish two objects on the ground in the azimuth direction, which is parallel to the radar's flight path.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incidence angle: The angle between the radar signal\u2019s line of sight (the path from the satellite to the target) and the perpendicular (normal) to the Earth\u2019s surface at the point where the radar beam hits the ground.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Nominal Ground Resolution: The expected ground resolution of amplitude data products resulting from SAR data acquired utilizing a specific imaging mode. This specification utilizes an incidence angle of 30 degrees to define nominal ground resolution for all imaging modes that utilize the Spotlight collection strategy. This is because, when utilizing this collection strategy, the ground resolution is typically limited by the incidence angle. This specification also provides a range of ground resolutions expected for the entire performance incidence angle range for these imaging modes.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Nominal Swath Width: The nominal swath width is the size of the image footprint in the range direction. The delivered image size in the range direction will be slightly larger than the Nominal Swath Width to ensure that the tasked area is fully covered.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nominal Swath Length: The nominal swath length is the size of the image footprint in the azimuth direction.\u00a0 The delivered image length may be slightly larger than the Nominal Swath Length to ensure that the tasked area is covered.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ): Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero describes the noise floor of an image. All received signals have to be stronger than the NESZ value to rise above the noise level, so it is best for NESZ to be as low as possible. The noise equivalent sigma zero values are taken at scene center for near and far range extents. The NESZ values presented in this specification are statistical values measured across the entire ICEYE fleet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performant Incidence Angle Range: The range of incidence angles within which the satellite's sensor can deliver optimal performance for each imaging mode. Images acquired within the performant incidence angle range are intended to meet the product specifications.\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Radar Beam: Refers to the radar signal emitted from a SAR system. ICEYE satellites use electronically steered elements to control multiple radar beams. All imaging modes with the exception of the Scan and Scan Wide modes use only one beam.\u00a0 Scan and Scan Wide modes use multiple beams to image different ranges (at the cost of reduced resolution).</p> </li> <li> <p>Radiometric Calibration: Radiometric calibration is the process of ensuring that the pixel values of the data products can be directly related to the power of the returned SAR signal. A calibration factor is applied to the pixel data in order to be able to calculate its mean radar cross section, which is a true measure of the radar reflectivity. All modes with the exception of the Scan and Scan Wide modes are radiometrically calibrated. While Scan and Scan Wide imagery is visually and spatially exploitable, there may be errors when converting image sample values to a mean radar cross section values.</p> </li> <li> <p>RGIQE: Radar General Image Quality Equation (RGIQE) is an adaptation of the concept of a General Image Quality Equation developed by NGA. Unlike the RNIIRS scale which is a largely subjective assessment of image quality, the RGIQE uses maximum channel capacity (measured in bits of information) as an objective figure of merit. A higher RGIQE value demonstrates that more 'information' is available for exploitation within the pixel vs. a lower RGIQE.</p> </li> <li> <p>RMSE: The RMSE is the Root Mean Square Error of all the measured calibration points from all the satellites. In Section 2.1 there is more explanation of how ICEYE uses RMSE to express the Geospatial Accuracy of its image products.\u00a0The RMSE values presented in this specification are statistical values measured across the entire ICEYE fleet.</p> </li> <li> <p>RNIIRS: Radar National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (RNIIRS) is a subjective assessment of Radar Image Quality used primarily by military analysts. The RNIIRS scale provides a means for comparing the quality of SAR images.\u00a0 The RNIIRS scale spans from 0 (the lowest quality:\u00a0 \"interpretability of the imagery is precluded by obscuration, degradation, or very poor resolution\") to 10 (highest quality figure of merit).</p> </li> <li> <p>Slant Range Resolution:\u00a0 Ability of the radar system to distinguish between two objects located at different distances along the slant range, which is the line-of-sight distance from the radar antenna to the target on the ground. Resolution of the radar image in the direction of the radar beam.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time Dominant Incidence Angle Range: The range of incidence angles within which the satellite sensor can produce an image in order to meet specific temporal or revisit requirements utilizing a specific imaging mode. This range ensures that the satellite can capture images of a target area within a specified time window, even if it means compromising slightly on image quality or resolution. Images acquired within the Time Dominant Incidence Angle Range but outside the Performant Incidence Angle Range of an imaging mode are not intended to meet the product specifications.\u00a0</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"productspecification/imagingmodes/","title":"2.

These are intended for applications that require high resolution, but where lower information density is sufficient. Please refer to section 2.2  for more information.</p> <p>Geospatial Accuracy refers to the accuracy with which a point in an ICEYE satellite image agrees with a true reference on the ground. Geospatial Accuracy here is evaluated as a statistical value: Each satellite in the ICEYE fleet is periodically evaluated against ground based calibration targets to obtain the geospatial accuracy of the system. This process involves measuring the location of each target in the SAR imagery after the image has been terrain corrected, and comparing each location to their known ground truth. Each calibration target will have its own slightly different error. The numeric value indicating Geospatial Accuracy in Table 2-1 above is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of all the measured calibration points from all the satellites, as meters. Note that the geospatial accuracy of a SAR image is a function of the accuracy of the terrain model used. Especially in high elevation terrains significant distortion can impact the accuracy. This means the values in this table cannot be guaranteed for every Digital Elevation Model (DEM) available. Moreover, irrespective of the DEM used, accuracy is decreased in high elevation areas due to geometric distortion.</p> <p>The Information Density figures tabulated in Table 2-1 describe the number of bits of imaging data per scene square meter. In principle, higher information densities offer potential for superior interpretability of an image. Larger scene sizes tend to have lower resolution and therefore lower information density. Also, for fixed scene size, e.g., 5 km x 5 km, higher information density products tend to have larger file sizes (see e.g. SLC Product Size rows in e.g. Table 2-5).</p> <p>For more information about each mode presented in Table 2-1, please follow the subsection references tabulated onto the last row.</p> <p>Each imaging mode subsection has one of each of the following tables:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tasking parameter tables provide the standard collection parameters applied to create the desired mode. These parameters are an input governing how the collection is performed (see Table 2-2 for an example). These tables describe parameters relating to the number of radar beams used, scene sizes, collection durations, and incidence angle ranges. Collections satisfying these criteria should result in products that satisfy the product specification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collection performance attribute tables describe the expected features of the resulting imagery when the performant tasking parameters for the imaging mode in question are utilized (see Table 2-3 for an example). These tables describe technical parameters related mostly to image quality and accuracy. Collection performance attributes will not be achieved for images that are tasked outside of the performant tasking parameters for each imaging mode, for example when images are tasked outside of their performant incidence angle range.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data product attribute tables describe attributes that are specific to the amplitude and complex data products that are generated with the collected SAR data. The ICEYE imaging modes can be used to generate both amplitude and complex data products and therefore these are described in product attributes for amplitude data products, and product attributes for complex data products tables, respectively (see Tables 2-4 and 2-5 for examples). No complex data product attribute tables are provided for the Scan and Scan Wide imaging modes, which are only offered as an amplitude data product.</p> </li> </ul> <p>ICEYE endeavors to continuously improve the performance of its SAR products. The values for attributes and parameters in this specification communicate the minimum performance values of our standard products across the current fleet at the time of publication. Note that values are approximate and may vary with image imaging mode, incidence angle, and contents of scene.</p> <p>Finally, many parameters, and performance and product attributes in this section deserve a detailed explanation in order to ensure they are properly understood.

Spot collections are performed with a 300 MHz pulse bandwidth to achieve a 0.5 m slant range resolution. ICEYE Gen2 and Gen3 satellites are both capable of Spot collections. Spot Fine collections are performed with a 600 MHz (see Section 1.4) pulse bandwidth to achieve a 0.25m slant range resolution. Currently, only Gen3 satellites are capable of Spot Fine collections. In both cases, the \u201cground range detected\u201d resolution degrades the resolution by a geometric factor as explained in Section 1.4 and thus the ground range detected resolutions of Spot and Spot Fine are 1 m and 50 cm, respectively (see \u201cGround Range Resolution\u201d in Table 2-4).</p> <p>ICEYE Spot and Spot Fine imaging modes cover an area of 5 km x 5 km for multi-looked amplitude images.

The radar beam 'slides' over the ground to cover a larger area; which is why SLEA is also known as Sliding Spot mode. This means that more area is imaged than in Spot mode.However, the trade-off is that each pixel in the image is illuminated from varying angles as the beam moves, leading to a reduction in image resolution compared to the standard Spot mode. To mitigate this resolution loss, the spotlight operation is extended by utilizing a slightly longer illumination time. This way, the imaging process captures information over the extended area, helping to preserve the resolution.</p> <p>As described in Table 2-6, the maximum scene size for SLEA is 15 km x 15 km and within the covered area a 1 m ground resolution can be achieved for multi-looked amplitude images.

Each of the modes leverages one of the following three SAR data Collection Strategies:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Spotlight. In the spotlight collection strategy the radar beam illuminates a fixed point for an extended period of time. This increases the illumination time and also increases the effective length of the synthetic aperture, improving the azimuth resolution. ICEYE offers six imaging modes based on this collection strategy optimizing different objectives (scene size, high resolution, low speckle, detection of movement and human-made objects). These six modes are Spot, Spot Fine, Spot Extended Area (SLEA), Dwell, Dwell Fine and Dwell Precise. These modes offer the finest resolution and image quality and are the best choice for object identification, detailed monitoring and change detection.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripmap. In the Stripmap collection strategy the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses while the antenna beam is fixed in its orientation. The beam is pointed off to the side of the satellite at an angle broadside to the satellite flight path. This results in a long image strip parallel to the flight direction. ICEYE offers one imaging mode, Strip, based on this collection strategy. Multiple Strip image frames can be collected in succession.\u00a0 Strip is ideal for applications for which resolution must be balanced with collection area.\u00a0 These use cases include detecting changes in large sea and land areas, characterization of natural disasters and illegal activities, as well as persistent monitoring of border and coastal areas</p> </li> <li> <p>ScanSAR. In the ScanSAR collection strategy the satellite\u2019s phased array antenna generates multiple radar beams in the range direction. This illuminates a wide area via multiple adjacent strips. However, because individual points on the ground are illuminated for a shorter duration, the trade-off is reduced resolution in exchange for a significantly larger scene size. ICEYE employs a refined version of this collection strategy known as TOPSAR, which additionally electronically steers the beam from backward to forward in the azimuth direction. This ensures consistent image quality across the captured area. ICEYE offers two imaging modes, Scan and Scan Wide, based on this strategy. Both are ideal for wide area surveillance and monitoring, for example large area maritime search, monitoring of vessels, detection of oil spills and enforcement of exclusive economic zones.\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> </ol> <p>All nine imaging modes are listed in Table 1-2 along with nominal ground resolution and scene size as well as the number of azimuth looks used in the image formation.
