We do this with our continually growing SAR satellite constellation, currently in orbit and delivering SAR data. This product guide reviews our constellation, products, imaging modes and ordering process. This is a living document because our innovative small SARs are flexible and they welcome our routine upgrades to their resolution, coverage and quality. We\u2019ll release new versions of this guide as we improve our sensors, expand our constellation, and streamline our order and delivery systems. SAR sensors see through clouds and darkness. They measure pulse echoes with a precision much smaller than a single wavelength. Their resolution is independent of distance. They are capable of pristine geolocation, and they are change detection machines. We Look Forward to Serving You The Small SAR Revolution in Earth Imaging During the Middle Ages, if you wanted to understand the way the world worked you would consult your local religious leader. A Priest or Prophet would interpret the Word of God from beautifully written tomes that were transcribed by hand over many years. These books were ornate and so precious that they could not be widely distributed, and most people did not know how to read. In these years, the thoughts of nations were controlled by various religious and political leaders. Then everything changed. The Renaissance and Reformation spurred new ways of thinking, and their ideas were recorded in printed books that were produced at low cost and in great volumes. People learned to read for themselves and think for themselves. Information spread across the globe. Sometimes disruption can be good. Hundreds of years later, in 2012, a small team of students working in the Nanosatellite Group of Aalto University considered the sequestered world of earth observation. The team was bothered by the limitations of government satellite programs in the same way that Renaissance and Reformation advocates challenged the knowledge control of the Middle Ages. Satellite imagery has been mostly provided by massive, government-owned or government-sponsored, exquisite systems. Like the tomes of old, these are beautifully implemented and precious. But normal people rarely have access to their images, and even when they are available, they do not have the timeliness to support the quick decisions needed in this rapidly changing world. The Nanosatellite students thought that timely, always available fine-resolution imagery should become a part of everyday life in the 21st century in the same way that GPS became integrated to nearly all businesses in the last decade of the 20th century. The humanitarian applications of easily-accessible imagery would include earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, glacial flow, and numerous environmental indicators. But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change. Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking. In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters. The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection. We will bring our users access to highly accurate, highly reliable monitoring, whenever and wherever they need it, at a pace that has never before existed.

In synthetic-aperture radar we take advantage of the natural coherence of radar illumination to produce structured and consistent pulses. These enable the measurement of slight pulse-to-pulse phase shifts and the use of frequency-modulated chirps. The innovations of aperture synthesis, modulated waveforms and pulse compression produce images capable of a remarkable pixel resolution and which does not degrade as distance to the ground increases. Even though they are handled differently, the azimuth and range processes have a fundamental similarity: Azimuth resolution is based on phase variations across the collection interval. These are compared to known phase variations across that area to produce a long \u201csynthetic\u201d aperture and a resolution cell narrow in azimuth. Range resolution is based on frequency variations across the returned pulse. These are compared to known frequency variations in the reference pulse to produce a short \u201csynthetic\u201d pulse and a resolution cell narrow in range. These processes result in two of the most simple and powerful equations in all of remote sensing. They are the equations that describe the spatial resolution of a SAR sensor. They are The Beautiful Equations : \\[ \\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] \\[ \\delta_{sr} = \\frac{c}{2B} \\] with \\(\\delta_{az}\\) and \\(\\delta_{sr}\\) being the azimuth resolution and the slant range resolution respectively.","title":"The Beautiful Equations"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/beautifulEquations/#the-beautiful-equations","text":"The brute force method of real-aperture radar cannot produce high-resolution images.

As shown in Figure 17, it is as if the \u201cskin\u201d of the pulse becomes thinner with distance. This weakening is dramatic; it decreases with the square of the distance from the antenna. Figure 17: Expanding Surface Area of a Pulse Given that the ground might be 750 km from the antenna, the pulse is quite weak by the time it finally reflects from surface objects. This presents even more of a problem because only a portion of the weakened pulse is reflected toward the receive antenna, and then it has to travel all the way back, weakening again with the square of the distance. By the time the microwaves return to the antenna, they are microscopically faint. The antenna and radar receiver manage to detect, amplify, and record these echoes so that they can be processed into SAR resolution cells that span more than 100,000 brightness values. SAR is amazing. The Challenge of Noise Those backscattered microwaves are so weak when they arrive at the antenna that they are perturbed by any noise sources that get mixed in with them. Noise is an artifact of random microwave emissions caused mostly by onboard sensor hardware. One of the tenets of remote sensing is that all objects emit electromagnetic energy based on their temperature. The thermal noise of heated receiver hardware spans wide swaths of the spectrum, including the microwave bands, and this competes with those whispering pulse echoes. As they struggle to capture those fading backscatter whispers, radar receivers also record random, interfering microwaves that they themselves produce. One of the disappointing aspects of the noise level is that it increases as range bandwidth increases. The large signal bandwidth that the receiver has to be capable of recording also lets more noise enter the receiver. One of the ways that noise is quantified for SAR sensors is called the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ). This parameter describes the noise floor of an image. All received signals have to be stronger than the NESZ value to rise above the noise level, so it is best for NESZ to be as low as possible. Images with high NESZ values look grainy. Unfortunately, NESZ is mystifying to SAR users who are not familiar with the dB language of engineering. Many users are confused by NESZ values like -20 dB, which actually indicates a fractional level of 1%. That is, an NESZ of -20 dB means the noise level is 1% as strong as a reference reflection from an idealized metal sphere. An NESZ of -17 dB would means the noise level is 2% as strong as the reference. System designers have to consider many competing imaging parameters to balance image quality, resolution and noise. For spacecraft, the best choices are increased average power, larger antennas, the use of high-quality receivers with low noise factors, steeper illumination angles, and lower orbits.","title":"Separating Signals From Noise"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/noise/#separating-signals-from-noise","text":"","title":"Separating Signals from Noise"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/noise/#the-whisper","text":"As a radar pulse travels from the antenna to the ground surface its total power remains constant, but as it moves away from the antenna, it spreads out into space and its power density weakens.

Ager 1 This comprehensive text was written for SAR users, not electrical engineers. It reviews the many interesting aspects of SAR and its uses that we cannot cover in this short overview. The Value of SAR Imaging Synthetic aperture radar is well known as the imaging technique that can see through clouds and darkness. But SAR provides a number of other capabilities that are simply not available from optical sources. These include: High Resolution Independent of Distance : One of the outstanding characteristics of SAR is that it is capable of detailed resolution regardless of how far away the sensor is from the ground. SAR sensors can provide very high resolution, even from space. Variable Resolution and Coverage : SAR illumination is controlled electronically, and it can be manipulated to vary resolution and coverage. Images can be collected over small areas at fine resolution, over medium-sized areas at medium resolution or over large areas at coarse resolution. Precision Geolocation : SAR measurements are inherently precise. Properly calibrated images can have geolocation accuracy less than the scale of a single pixel for well-defined features. Coherent Illumination and Many Products : The controlled nature of SAR imaging enables the formation of images and many other products. These include sub-aperture image stacks that highlight glinting features and motion, dense elevation models, precise measurements of surface motion, and amplitude and coherent change detection pairs or series. Radar Bands There are several radar bands ranging from wavelengths at the millimeter level to a full meter (Table 1). X-Band has the best combination of cloud-penetration and resolution for spaceborne sensors. In addition to atmospheric gases, there are larger atmospheric particles that scatter visible light but which are transparent to microwaves. In addition to penetrating clouds, X-band radar waves travel through smog, volcanic ash, and sandstorms.

The sensor records the \u201cbackscatter\u201d, which is the portion reflected toward the antenna. It measures the strength of the echo and the time it took for the pulse to travel to the ground and back. Figure 1: Pulse Transmission and Backscatter Signal strength corresponds to pixel brightness and the timing provides range information. The range is one-half the total travel time. In the equation below, \\(\\Delta T\\) is the travel time and \\(c\\) is the speed of light: \\[Range = \\frac{\\Delta T\\ c}{2}\\] Side-Looking Illumination Since the pixels of a radar imaging system are placed on the image based partly on their range, the antenna cannot illuminate the ground in a vertical orientation. If it did, features on the same imaging line at equivalent angles off nadir would have identical ranges, like the two purple diamonds in Figure 2, and they would occupy the same pixel location. Figure 2: Vertical Illumination Radar imaging must be side-looking so that ground points from the near to far range have different range values (Figure 3). The illumination is typically broadside, or perpendicular, to the flight direction. Figure 3: Side-Looking Illumination Radar Angles The angles associated with radar illumination are shown in Figure 4, which is based on a spherical earth surface. Most radar imaging is broadside to the flight direction, but some systems can collect off-broadside in a squinted orientation. The angle down from the local level at the sensor is called the depression angle. The angle between the line-of-sight ray and the local vertical is the incidence angle. The angle between the tangent to the surface and the line of sight is the grazing angle. Note that the incidence and grazing angles are complements in that they form a right angle when combined. This means that a 60\u00b0 incidence angle is the same as a 30\u00b0 grazing angle. Figure 4: Radar Imaging Angles Side Looking Airborne Radar The first useful radar imaging technique was a form called Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) (Figure 5). The image is built up via the forward motion of the antenna, one line at a time. The pulses are emitted at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which can range from a few hundred pulses each second for airborne systems to thousands each second for spacecraft. In the SLAR technique, the individual pulses create each image line. The angular width of the pulse on the ground along the direction of flight, or azimuth direction, determines one component of resolution. The range measurements are collected in the \u201cslant range\u201d direction, and range variations to different objects form the second dimension of resolution. Figure 5: Side-Looking Airborne Radar SLAR was used the early days of radar imaging but it had serious limitations. Range resolution was one-half the length of the pulse in the range direction. Since the pulses are emitted at light speed, even a very brief pulse of one-millionth of a second would be 300 meters long and produce range resolution of 150 meters (Figure 6). Azimuth resolution was based on the angular width of the pulse in the azimuth direction ( \\(\\beta\\) ). Long antennas create narrow beams, but the beam spreads out from the antenna to the distant ground surface. Antennas cannot be made long enough to produce good azimuth resolution, and SLAR produced images with resolutions in the hundreds of meters, even from aircraft. This is why the brilliant concept of synthesizing a long antenna from the actions of a small one was developed. We call this Synthetic Aperture Radar. Figure 6: SLAR Pulse Dimensions The Remarkable Story of Synthetic Aperture Radar Improving Azimuth Resolution by Synthesizing a Long Antenna It takes a long antenna to create narrow radar beams, but the aperture itself does not have to be a giant physical antenna. Instead, a \u201csynthetic\u201d aperture can be created from a small antenna and a linear extent of recording locations. Figure 7 shows a radar antenna sequentially emitting a series of pulses, like a microwave strobe light, and recording the echoes from a string of receive positions. Figure 7: Linear Extent of Recording Locations In the SAR technique all of the measurements are stored and later processed together. It is as if they were collected from one long antenna equal in length to the extent of the sensor locations that received the echoes. Synthetic Aperture Radar is a post-processing scheme applied to data collected by a standard radar antenna and receiver. Stripmap and Spotlight Apertures There are a few methods to illuminate the ground in SAR imaging. These collection modes trade off resolution and coverage in different ways. To establish how we can simulate long apertures we\u2019ll contrast the two most common forms of SAR imaging: stripmap and spotlight. In stripmap mode the pulses are sent out at a constant angle, usually broadside to the flight direction. In this case, the length of this simulated aperture ( \\(L\\) ) is the same as the width of the beam on the ground (Figure 8). Wider beams produced by smaller antennas mean longer apertures and better azimuth resolution. This directly contrasts with the real-aperture radar of SLAR where the beam was kept as narrow as possible to obtain good resolution. Figure 8: Stripmap Synthetic Aperture The spotlight form of SAR varies the boresight angle in the azimuth direction to illuminate a fixed ground location (Figure 9). This technique greatly increases the synthetic-aperture length and offers excellent azimuth resolution, at the cost of limited ground coverage. At ICEYE we are capable of illuminating a fixed spot for as long as 30 seconds. Given the velocity of low-earth orbits (7.5 km/sec), this yields a synthetic aperture more than 225 kilometers long ! Figure 9: Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Phase History Data and SAR Azimuth Resolution We can create long \u201csynthetic\u201d apertures because radar illumination is coherent. That is, the sensor controls the structure of the transmitted pulses and they all have the same form. It emits pulses and measures the details of each echo: time, strength and \u201cphase\u201d. Phase refers to the position of the wave in its cycle, denoting whether it is at its peak, trough or somewhere in between. The SAR antenna moves only slightly from pulse to pulse. It turns out that the change in location must be less than one-half the antenna length. But this small change in location causes the successive measurements of the range to some object to change as well. The slight change in position imparts a slight change in range. Since the phase is dependent on the range, the small change in adjacent sensor locations also imparts a slight change in phase. These phase changes form a pattern across the aperture, which changes depending on the azimuth location of a ground feature. The record of all the changing phases for all the scatterers in the scene is called phase history data. For a particular object, this is the \u201chistory\u201d of how phase changed from one receive location to the next. Given carefully measured sensor locations, the phase histories for each location across the scene are predictable. The azimuth position of each scatterer can be calculated by comparing the predicted phase pattern of some location to the measured phase history pattern for that point. This is the essence of azimuth resolution. Phase history data and their reference patterns are compared to discriminate the azimuth position of scatterers in the scene. Now that we have that huge aperture and the equation for azimuth resolution becomes: \\[ \\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] where \\(\\delta_{az}\\) is the SAR azimuth resolution. This equation is gorgeous. It says that azimuth resolution is based on the wavelength of our radar waves and the change in the integration angle ( \\(\\Delta \\theta\\) ) while the point was being imaged (Figure 10). Resolution improves when the wavelength is small and the integration angle change is large. Figure 10: Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Angle Now let\u2019s use SAR with an integration angle change of 0.07 radians (4.5\u00b0). This is reasonable because the current operational performance of ICEYE's spotlight mode can easily exceed this angle. \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{3 cm}{2 \\times 0.07} \\] \\[\\delta_{az} = 0.21m \\] For stripmap mode the azimuth resolution equation reduces to a simpler form, where \\(D_A\\) is the length of the antenna in the azimuth direction: \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{D_A}{2} \\] This is just a special stripmap case of the more general equation, but it seems to imply that we could make the antenna really small to achieve good stripmap resolution. While this is literally true, the small size of the antenna would lessen the total power that could be transmitted and also degrade the ability to record the weak backscattered echoes. Noise would increase significantly. It would also require the PRF to get unreasonably large because a pulse is required at least every one-half antenna length. Stripmap cannot support high-resolution SAR. For that we need to steer the beam during illumination to increase the synthetic aperture, as with a spotlight collection. This mode is capable of fine resolution and it can use a larger, and therefore more powerful and sensitive antenna. Something Is Missing These elegant equations are an astonishing statement about resolution, but it is even more amazing when we consider what is missing. Notice that the SAR azimuth resolution equations do not include a term for distance. Use it on an aircraft or move it all the way out into space, and azimuth resolution does not change. Of course, distance does impact signal strength. When the sensor is further away, the signal strength weakens dramatically and this poses serious challenges to the SAR imaging process. We will not discuss this issue in this overview, but we can say here that radar antennas are very sensitive. Spaceborne SARs successfully record very weak backscatters. Fixing Range Resolution by Synthesizing a Short Pulse In our discussions about aperture synthesis, we did not say anything about range resolution. This is because the \u201csynthetic aperture\u201d technique itself deals only with azimuth. It does not do anything to address the problem we saw with brute-force range resolution. Recall that this is one-half of the pulse length, which is the speed of light ( \\(c\\) ) times the pulse duration, \\(T\\) : \\[\\delta_{ra} = \\frac{c\\ T}{2}\\] where \\(\\delta_{ra}\\) is the slant range resolution. Thus far, we have described our radar pulses as if they have a fixed frequency, like X-band pulses of 10 GHz frequency and a 3 cm wavelength. But most radars actually transmit chirped pulses in which the frequency changes (Figure 11). Notice how the wavelength of the green pulse is manipulated and varies from long to short Figure 11: Chirped Pulse When we state the frequency or wavelength of a SAR sensor, those values typically apply at the mid-way time of the pulse. This is known as the radar center frequency or wavelength. The actual transmitted wavelengths are varied quite a bit on either side to form chirped pulses (Figure 12). Figure 12: Centre Frequency There are many different pulse modulation techniques, but the chirp with a smoothly varying frequency is most common. A chirped pulse is easy to produce and since the total transmitted energy is a product of amplitude and duration, a long pulse can contain a substantial amount of energy without needing a large peak power. A chirped pulse enables high range resolution because its form is exactly specified and its echo is a reversed and weakened copy. The reflection has the same shape as the emitted signal, it\u2019s just flipped and has a much smaller amplitude. The two are compared in what is called a matched filter process. The known structure of the emitted pulse is compared to the echo at various locations. A calculation is performed, and if they are misaligned the result of this calculation is zero. At the exact location where they match there is a strong signal that indicates the match. A synthetic pulse that is narrow in range replaces the spread-out pulse (Figure 13). Figure 13: Range Compression The width of the compressed pulse is based entirely on the bandwidth of the emitted pulse. The slant range resolution equation is transformed: \\[ \\delta_{slant\\ range\\ chirp\\ compressed} = \\frac{c}{2B} \\] This is a really beautiful equation. It is so simple and powerful. Resolution in range is entirely based on how much bandwidth we impart to chirped pulses, and like its azimuth counterpart it has nothing whatsoever to do with distance to the ground. Slant Range Resolution Examples So how much can we vary pulse frequency? Well, bandwidths can be made really large. Consider an X-band system capable of 300,000,000 cycles per second (300 MHz) of bandwidth. We can calculate resolution in the slant range: \\[ \\delta_{sr} = \\frac{3\\times10^8\\ m/sec}{2\\times300MHz} \\] \\[ \\delta_{sr} = \\frac{3\\times10^8\\ m/sec}{2\\times300\\times10^8Hz} \\] \\[ \\delta_{sr} = 0.5 metres \\] Plans for the next generation of ICEYE satellites include pulse bandwidths of 600 MHz and 1200 MHz. These will yield a slant range resolution cell of 0.25 meters and better from a satellite that is perhaps 750,000 meters away from the imaged area. Ground Range Resolution The slant range is the distance between the antenna and the target, and that is the direction where range resolution is measured. To produce images along the ground surface, the pixels have to be projected to the \u201cground range\u201d from their original slant range orientation (Figure 14). This has the effect of elongating the pixels in range. Figure 14: Ground Range Resolution The illustration shows the relationship between slant range resolution, shown in blue, and the length of the equivalent resolution distance along the ground, shown in green. When the illumination is steep, as in this example, the projection to the ground surface results in a much longer ground range cell. You can imagine what would happen as the steepness continued to approach nadir. This is exactly opposite to the situation with optical imaging resolution, which is best at nadir. Slant range and ground range resolution comparisons for two incidence angles are shown in Table 2. Notice the dramatic increase for the steeper illumination. Incidence Angle 30\u00b0 Incidence Angle 60\u00b0 Slant Range 0.50m 0.50m Ground Range 1.00m 0.55m Table 2: Resolution comparison between slant range and ground range While slant range resolution seems \u201cbetter\u201d than ground range resolution, keep in mind that it refers to the sensor\u2019s ability to discriminate features along the oblique path of the energy. Most of the features we care about lie along the ground surface, and ground range resolution is a useful way to describe image resolution. The Beautiful Equations The brute force method of real-aperture radar cannot produce high-resolution images. In synthetic-aperture radar we take advantage of the natural coherence of radar illumination to produce structured and consistent pulses. These enable the measurement of slight pulse-to-pulse phase shifts and the use of frequency-modulated chirps. The innovations of aperture synthesis, modulated waveforms and pulse compression produce images capable of a remarkable pixel resolution and which does not degrade as distance to the ground increases. Even though they are handled differently, the azimuth and range processes have a fundamental similarity: Azimuth resolution is based on phase variations across the collection interval. These are compared to known phase variations across that area to produce a long \u201csynthetic\u201d aperture and a resolution cell narrow in azimuth. Range resolution is based on frequency variations across the returned pulse. These are compared to known frequency variations in the reference pulse to produce a short \u201csynthetic\u201d pulse and a resolution cell narrow in range. These processes result in two of the most simple and powerful equations in all of remote sensing. They are the equations that describe the spatial resolution of a SAR sensor. They are The Beautiful Equations : \\[ \\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] \\[ \\delta_{sr} = \\frac{c}{2B} \\] with \\(\\delta_{az}\\) and \\(\\delta_{sr}\\) being the azimuth resolution and the slant range resolution respectively. The SAR Processing Flow and Its Products SAR image generation begins with the emission of thousands of coherent pulses and the decomposition of each echo into raw measurements of time, amplitude and phase. The first part of the processing flow is called Phase History Processing because it accounts for the changes over time of the phase values of each scatterer. Phase history data are focused into the azimuth and range components of each resolution cell to produce an image product called a \u201ccomplex image\u201d (Figure 15). Figure 15: The SAR Processing Flow and Its Products The Complex Image Info By the way, you will hear SAR engineers refer to the two parameters of a complex image as \u201cIn-Phase\u201d and \u201cQuadrature\u201d. These are just another way to describe the complex values. The left image in Figure 16 is a ICEYE amplitude image of agricultural fields. In this image each pixel has a brightness value assigned to it. This is what many people consider to be the base SAR product, but this is really only half of the full image. The SAR processor calculates the average phase value for each pixel as well. The matching \u201cphase image\u201d of that same scene is on the right in the figure. The combination of these two images is called a complex image, in which every pixel has amplitude and phase values. We use the term \u201ccomplex\u201d because the pixels are described by a mathematical construct called a complex number, where every number has two components. Figure 16: Amplitude and Phase Structure of a Complex Image Of course, phase data are not useful for direct human interpretation. And while they may look like random noise, phase pixels are a unique and valuable aspect of SAR imaging. Phase data can be used to manipulate the synthetic aperture in different ways to extract useful information that is not available from amplitude images. Moreover, changes in the phase measurements of the same object on different images can be used to detect small surface structure characteristics. In the next section we\u2019ll discuss how we can use phase data to refine images and create other products. SAR Products Derived from Complex Data Amplitude Images Info You should also be aware that an engineering calculation called \u201cdetection\u201d converts in-phase and quadrature values to amplitude values. Engineers often refer to SAR amplitude images as \u201cdetected\u201d images. An amplitude image is certainly the most common SAR product, but you need to appreciate that this image is produced for human viewing and analysis. It is not the core image product. Amplitude images do not contain any phase information. Furthermore, the version of the amplitude image used for human viewing is not a direct copy of the amplitude values in a complex image. This is because radar sensors record an enormous span of brightness levels for each complex pixel. The maximum intensity of amplitude in a complex image is usually more than 100,000 times (50 dB) the minimum intensity, and for the best-quality images with bright targets, it is much greater. ICEYE images are produced with 16 bits of dynamic range per pixel (65536 gray levels) but even this is not sufficient to record the full dynamic range of SAR. As valuable as they are, amplitude images have no phase data and they lose much of the dynamic range of complex pixels. You can imagine the growing potential for computers and algorithms to process those complex pixels in ways the human visual system cannot. Multi-look Amplitude Images One way in which we can use complex data is to produce different versions of the seemingly simple amplitude image. One common form of an amplitude image, for example, is called a multi-look image. Consider that azimuth and range resolution are handled independently. One is based on the length of the synthetic aperture and the other is based on the signal bandwidth, and sometimes these are quite different in magnitude. It is common for azimuth resolution to be collected at a higher fidelity than range resolution. If a full-resolution image were produced from such data it would look compressed in range. To view the image in a more natural aspect we need to \u201csquare the pixels\u201d so that the range and azimuth scales are the same. Info Speckle is a grainy, noise-like feature of SAR images. It is caused by the coherent nature of SAR illumination. The reflections from small scatterers within a resolution cell combine constructively and destructively to brighten or darken the returns. This is done by manipulating the synthetic aperture into smaller sub-apertures and then combining them. The sub-apertures are called \u201clooks\u201d and they each produce an image with lower azimuth resolution. This may sound disappointing, but when these individual sub-aperture images are combined, they form a multi-look image in which the noisy effect of speckle is reduced. Complex images are stored at full-resolution and are called single-look complex (SLC) images. Amplitude images are typically multi-looked in azimuth using two to 12 sub-apertures. If range resolution exceeds azimuth resolution a similar multi-look process can be applied in the range dimension. Sub-aperture Stack or Video Image Suppose we take the aperture splitting further and create six or seven segments to produce multiple sub-aperture images. One advantage of this sub-aperture stack is that it can indicate glints that are bright in only a portion of the full aperture. This signature might be washed out on the full-resolution image by the bulk of the aperture in which there was no glinting, but it can be very noticeable in one of the low-resolution sub-apertures. Glints tend to be important signatures because they are usually caused by human-made features. We could even loop the stack like a short movie, or SAR video image, to look for such glints and moving objects. This product works best for long spotlight exposures of ten seconds or more. Amplitude and Coherent Change Detection Perhaps the most useful SAR products are the amplitude and coherent change detection images (ACD, CCD). Two or more images of the same site are collected at different times to detect scene changes. For ACD only the brightness values are compared, while CCD uses phase data. In order for change detection to work, the images have to be collected from nearly the same location in space with similar illumination geometries. For ACD the two images can be overlaid in the complementary colors (eg red and cyan). In this way, features with similar backscatters will be gray, but features with backscatters that changed during the imaging period will appear in one of the two colors. It is conventional for the first image to be displayed in red and the second in cyan. If something on the ground changes between the two collections you will see whichever color signature is dominant. A mnemonic is used to help interpret ACD products: \u201cRed is fled. Blue is new\u201d. That is, a red signature indicates a feature that was present on the first image but left the scene prior to the second image, and a blue signature indicates a feature that appears only on the second image. This mnemonic is an easy way to help remember the order of the images, but appreciate that the second image is actually cyan, not blue. The intentional sloppiness of the mnemonic is acceptable here because verbal precision would ruin the rhyme. In contrast to amplitude change detection, CCD compares the phase values of two nearly identical images taken at different times. CCD is far more sensitive to changes because it is based on phase differences rather than pixel brightness differences and, as we know, phase is measured to within a small fraction of a wavelength. The collection constraints to ensure image-to-image coherence are tighter for CCD than ACD. When the collection parameters are nearly identical, the phase values are also nearly identical, and any changes are due to backscatter differences at a scale of less than one wavelength. It is typical for CCD images to display pixels where phase is consistent in white and the pixels where the phase has changed are dark. These are areas where the two images have \u201cdecorrelated\u201d, or lost phase consistency, due to some subtle change in the scene. Other Multi-image SAR Products The amplitude and phase data of SAR images can be combined to produce other useful products that are too numerous to describe in detail in this overview. These include digital elevation models derived from pixel brightness values or phase data, millimeter-level surface motion measurements derived phase comparisons of sets of matching images, and automated detections of ships, oil spills and other features. Once constellations of small SARs are established it will be possible to monitor any site in the world with large stacks of exactly matching images whose consistent signatures are linked to known ground features. These images could be collected within hours of each other and they will be the basis of intelligent site monitoring services that will not only detect changes, but which will also say what has changed and how it has changed. Separating Signals from Noise The Whisper As a radar pulse travels from the antenna to the ground surface its total power remains constant, but as it moves away from the antenna, it spreads out into space and its power density weakens. As shown in Figure 17, it is as if the \u201cskin\u201d of the pulse becomes thinner with distance. This weakening is dramatic; it decreases with the square of the distance from the antenna. Figure 17: Expanding Surface Area of a Pulse Given that the ground might be 750 km from the antenna, the pulse is quite weak by the time it finally reflects from surface objects. This presents even more of a problem because only a portion of the weakened pulse is reflected toward the receive antenna, and then it has to travel all the way back, weakening again with the square of the distance. By the time the microwaves return to the antenna, they are microscopically faint. The antenna and radar receiver manage to detect, amplify, and record these echoes so that they can be processed into SAR resolution cells that span more than 100,000 brightness values. SAR is amazing. The Challenge of Noise Those backscattered microwaves are so weak when they arrive at the antenna that they are perturbed by any noise sources that get mixed in with them. Noise is an artifact of random microwave emissions caused mostly by onboard sensor hardware. One of the tenets of remote sensing is that all objects emit electromagnetic energy based on their temperature. The thermal noise of heated receiver hardware spans wide swaths of the spectrum, including the microwave bands, and this competes with those whispering pulse echoes. As they struggle to capture those fading backscatter whispers, radar receivers also record random, interfering microwaves that they themselves produce. One of the disappointing aspects of the noise level is that it increases as range bandwidth increases. The large signal bandwidth that the receiver has to be capable of recording also lets more noise enter the receiver. One of the ways that noise is quantified for SAR sensors is called the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ). This parameter describes the noise floor of an image. All received signals have to be stronger than the NESZ value to rise above the noise level, so it is best for NESZ to be as low as possible. Images with high NESZ values look grainy. Unfortunately, NESZ is mystifying to SAR users who are not familiar with the dB language of engineering. Many users are confused by NESZ values like -20 dB, which actually indicates a fractional level of 1%. That is, an NESZ of -20 dB means the noise level is 1% as strong as a reference reflection from an idealized metal sphere. An NESZ of -17 dB would means the noise level is 2% as strong as the reference. System designers have to consider many competing imaging parameters to balance image quality, resolution and noise. For spacecraft, the best choices are increased average power, larger antennas, the use of high-quality receivers with low noise factors, steeper illumination angles, and lower orbits. The ICEYE Innovation In this overview of SAR, we have discussed several remarkable capabilities beyond its famous ability to penetrate clouds. These include image resolution independent of distance, electronic beam control to vary resolution and coverage, pristine geolocation, and the natural ability to measure phase to within a small fraction of a wavelength. We\u2019ve seen that SAR pixels have both amplitude and phase, and from these we can produce many useful products. At ICEYE, we have developed an innovative way to incorporate all of these aspects of SAR in our small and adaptable systems. We are launching a full constellation of small SARs, and we\u2019ll upgrade them routinely to better image this ocean planet. References Thomas P. Ager.

The image is built up via the forward motion of the antenna, one line at a time. The pulses are emitted at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which can range from a few hundred pulses each second for airborne systems to thousands each second for spacecraft. In the SLAR technique, the individual pulses create each image line. The angular width of the pulse on the ground along the direction of flight, or azimuth direction, determines one component of resolution. The range measurements are collected in the \u201cslant range\u201d direction, and range variations to different objects form the second dimension of resolution. Figure 5: Side-Looking Airborne Radar SLAR was used the early days of radar imaging but it had serious limitations. Range resolution was one-half the length of the pulse in the range direction. Since the pulses are emitted at light speed, even a very brief pulse of one-millionth of a second would be 300 meters long and produce range resolution of 150 meters (Figure 6). Azimuth resolution was based on the angular width of the pulse in the azimuth direction ( \\(\\beta\\) ). Long antennas create narrow beams, but the beam spreads out from the antenna to the distant ground surface. Antennas cannot be made long enough to produce good azimuth resolution, and SLAR produced images with resolutions in the hundreds of meters, even from aircraft. This is why the brilliant concept of synthesizing a long antenna from the actions of a small one was developed. We call this Synthetic Aperture Radar.

These collection modes trade off resolution and coverage in different ways. To establish how we can simulate long apertures we\u2019ll contrast the two most common forms of SAR imaging: stripmap and spotlight. In stripmap mode the pulses are sent out at a constant angle, usually broadside to the flight direction. In this case, the length of this simulated aperture ( \\(L\\) ) is the same as the width of the beam on the ground (Figure 8). Wider beams produced by smaller antennas mean longer apertures and better azimuth resolution. This directly contrasts with the real-aperture radar of SLAR where the beam was kept as narrow as possible to obtain good resolution. Figure 8: Stripmap Synthetic Aperture The spotlight form of SAR varies the boresight angle in the azimuth direction to illuminate a fixed ground location (Figure 9). This technique greatly increases the synthetic-aperture length and offers excellent azimuth resolution, at the cost of limited ground coverage. At ICEYE we are capable of illuminating a fixed spot for as long as 30 seconds. Given the velocity of low-earth orbits (7.5 km/sec), this yields a synthetic aperture more than 225 kilometers long !

That is, the sensor controls the structure of the transmitted pulses and they all have the same form. It emits pulses and measures the details of each echo: time, strength and \u201cphase\u201d. Phase refers to the position of the wave in its cycle, denoting whether it is at its peak, trough or somewhere in between. The SAR antenna moves only slightly from pulse to pulse. It turns out that the change in location must be less than one-half the antenna length. But this small change in location causes the successive measurements of the range to some object to change as well. The slight change in position imparts a slight change in range. Since the phase is dependent on the range, the small change in adjacent sensor locations also imparts a slight change in phase. These phase changes form a pattern across the aperture, which changes depending on the azimuth location of a ground feature. The record of all the changing phases for all the scatterers in the scene is called phase history data. For a particular object, this is the \u201chistory\u201d of how phase changed from one receive location to the next. Given carefully measured sensor locations, the phase histories for each location across the scene are predictable. The azimuth position of each scatterer can be calculated by comparing the predicted phase pattern of some location to the measured phase history pattern for that point. This is the essence of azimuth resolution. Phase history data and their reference patterns are compared to discriminate the azimuth position of scatterers in the scene. Now that we have that huge aperture and the equation for azimuth resolution becomes: \\[ \\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] where \\(\\delta_{az}\\) is the SAR azimuth resolution. This equation is gorgeous. It says that azimuth resolution is based on the wavelength of our radar waves and the change in the integration angle ( \\(\\Delta \\theta\\) ) while the point was being imaged (Figure 10). Resolution improves when the wavelength is small and the integration angle change is large. Figure 10: Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Angle Now let\u2019s use SAR with an integration angle change of 0.07 radians (4.5\u00b0). This is reasonable because the current operational performance of ICEYE's spotlight mode can easily exceed this angle. \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{3 cm}{2 \\times 0.07} \\] \\[\\delta_{az} = 0.21m \\] For stripmap mode the azimuth resolution equation reduces to a simpler form, where \\(D_A\\) is the length of the antenna in the azimuth direction: \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{D_A}{2} \\] This is just a special stripmap case of the more general equation, but it seems to imply that we could make the antenna really small to achieve good stripmap resolution. While this is literally true, the small size of the antenna would lessen the total power that could be transmitted and also degrade the ability to record the weak backscattered echoes. Noise would increase significantly. It would also require the PRF to get unreasonably large because a pulse is required at least every one-half antenna length. Stripmap cannot support high-resolution SAR. For that we need to steer the beam during illumination to increase the synthetic aperture, as with a spotlight collection. This mode is capable of fine resolution and it can use a larger, and therefore more powerful and sensitive antenna.","title":"Phase History Data and SAR Azimuth Resolution"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/overviewofSAR-fulltext/#something-is-missing","text":"These elegant equations are an astonishing statement about resolution, but it is even more amazing when we consider what is missing.

Thus far, we have described our radar pulses as if they have a fixed frequency, like X-band pulses of 10 GHz frequency and a 3 cm wavelength. But most radars actually transmit chirped pulses in which the frequency changes (Figure 11). Notice how the wavelength of the green pulse is manipulated and varies from long to short Figure 11: Chirped Pulse When we state the frequency or wavelength of a SAR sensor, those values typically apply at the mid-way time of the pulse. This is known as the radar center frequency or wavelength. The actual transmitted wavelengths are varied quite a bit on either side to form chirped pulses (Figure 12). Figure 12: Centre Frequency There are many different pulse modulation techniques, but the chirp with a smoothly varying frequency is most common. A chirped pulse is easy to produce and since the total transmitted energy is a product of amplitude and duration, a long pulse can contain a substantial amount of energy without needing a large peak power. A chirped pulse enables high range resolution because its form is exactly specified and its echo is a reversed and weakened copy. The reflection has the same shape as the emitted signal, it\u2019s just flipped and has a much smaller amplitude. The two are compared in what is called a matched filter process. The known structure of the emitted pulse is compared to the echo at various locations. A calculation is performed, and if they are misaligned the result of this calculation is zero. At the exact location where they match there is a strong signal that indicates the match. A synthetic pulse that is narrow in range replaces the spread-out pulse (Figure 13).

This has the effect of elongating the pixels in range. Figure 14: Ground Range Resolution The illustration shows the relationship between slant range resolution, shown in blue, and the length of the equivalent resolution distance along the ground, shown in green. When the illumination is steep, as in this example, the projection to the ground surface results in a much longer ground range cell. You can imagine what would happen as the steepness continued to approach nadir. This is exactly opposite to the situation with optical imaging resolution, which is best at nadir.

Amplitude images do not contain any phase information. Furthermore, the version of the amplitude image used for human viewing is not a direct copy of the amplitude values in a complex image. This is because radar sensors record an enormous span of brightness levels for each complex pixel. The maximum intensity of amplitude in a complex image is usually more than 100,000 times (50 dB) the minimum intensity, and for the best-quality images with bright targets, it is much greater. ICEYE images are produced with 16 bits of dynamic range per pixel (65536 gray levels) but even this is not sufficient to record the full dynamic range of SAR.

One common form of an amplitude image, for example, is called a multi-look image. Consider that azimuth and range resolution are handled independently. One is based on the length of the synthetic aperture and the other is based on the signal bandwidth, and sometimes these are quite different in magnitude. It is common for azimuth resolution to be collected at a higher fidelity than range resolution. If a full-resolution image were produced from such data it would look compressed in range. To view the image in a more natural aspect we need to \u201csquare the pixels\u201d so that the range and azimuth scales are the same. Info Speckle is a grainy, noise-like feature of SAR images. It is caused by the coherent nature of SAR illumination. The reflections from small scatterers within a resolution cell combine constructively and destructively to brighten or darken the returns. This is done by manipulating the synthetic aperture into smaller sub-apertures and then combining them. The sub-apertures are called \u201clooks\u201d and they each produce an image with lower azimuth resolution. This may sound disappointing, but when these individual sub-aperture images are combined, they form a multi-look image in which the noisy effect of speckle is reduced. Complex images are stored at full-resolution and are called single-look complex (SLC) images. Amplitude images are typically multi-looked in azimuth using two to 12 sub-apertures.

Two or more images of the same site are collected at different times to detect scene changes. For ACD only the brightness values are compared, while CCD uses phase data. In order for change detection to work, the images have to be collected from nearly the same location in space with similar illumination geometries. For ACD the two images can be overlaid in the complementary colors (eg red and cyan). In this way, features with similar backscatters will be gray, but features with backscatters that changed during the imaging period will appear in one of the two colors. It is conventional for the first image to be displayed in red and the second in cyan. If something on the ground changes between the two collections you will see whichever color signature is dominant. A mnemonic is used to help interpret ACD products: \u201cRed is fled. Blue is new\u201d. That is, a red signature indicates a feature that was present on the first image but left the scene prior to the second image, and a blue signature indicates a feature that appears only on the second image. This mnemonic is an easy way to help remember the order of the images, but appreciate that the second image is actually cyan, not blue. The intentional sloppiness of the mnemonic is acceptable here because verbal precision would ruin the rhyme. In contrast to amplitude change detection, CCD compares the phase values of two nearly identical images taken at different times. CCD is far more sensitive to changes because it is based on phase differences rather than pixel brightness differences and, as we know, phase is measured to within a small fraction of a wavelength. The collection constraints to ensure image-to-image coherence are tighter for CCD than ACD. When the collection parameters are nearly identical, the phase values are also nearly identical, and any changes are due to backscatter differences at a scale of less than one wavelength.

The thermal noise of heated receiver hardware spans wide swaths of the spectrum, including the microwave bands, and this competes with those whispering pulse echoes. As they struggle to capture those fading backscatter whispers, radar receivers also record random, interfering microwaves that they themselves produce. One of the disappointing aspects of the noise level is that it increases as range bandwidth increases. The large signal bandwidth that the receiver has to be capable of recording also lets more noise enter the receiver. One of the ways that noise is quantified for SAR sensors is called the Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ). This parameter describes the noise floor of an image. All received signals have to be stronger than the NESZ value to rise above the noise level, so it is best for NESZ to be as low as possible. Images with high NESZ values look grainy. Unfortunately, NESZ is mystifying to SAR users who are not familiar with the dB language of engineering. Many users are confused by NESZ values like -20 dB, which actually indicates a fractional level of 1%. That is, an NESZ of -20 dB means the noise level is 1% as strong as a reference reflection from an idealized metal sphere. An NESZ of -17 dB would means the noise level is 2% as strong as the reference. System designers have to consider many competing imaging parameters to balance image quality, resolution and noise.

These will yield a slant range resolution cell of 0.25 meters and better from a satellite that is perhaps 750,000 meters away from the imaged area. Ground Range Resolution The slant range is the distance between the antenna and the target, and that is the direction where range resolution is measured. To produce images along the ground surface, the pixels have to be projected to the \u201cground range\u201d from their original slant range orientation (Figure 14). This has the effect of elongating the pixels in range.

This is because the \u201csynthetic aperture\u201d technique itself deals only with azimuth. It does not do anything to address the problem we saw with brute-force range resolution. Recall that this is one-half of the pulse length, which is the speed of light ( \\(c\\) ) times the pulse duration, \\(T\\) : \\[\\delta_{ra} = \\frac{c\\ T}{2}\\] where \\(\\delta_{ra}\\) is the slant range resolution. Thus far, we have described our radar pulses as if they have a fixed frequency, like X-band pulses of 10 GHz frequency and a 3 cm wavelength. But most radars actually transmit chirped pulses in which the frequency changes (Figure 11). Notice how the wavelength of the green pulse is manipulated and varies from long to short Figure 11: Chirped Pulse When we state the frequency or wavelength of a SAR sensor, those values typically apply at the mid-way time of the pulse. This is known as the radar center frequency or wavelength. The actual transmitted wavelengths are varied quite a bit on either side to form chirped pulses (Figure 12). Figure 12: Centre Frequency There are many different pulse modulation techniques, but the chirp with a smoothly varying frequency is most common. A chirped pulse is easy to produce and since the total transmitted energy is a product of amplitude and duration, a long pulse can contain a substantial amount of energy without needing a large peak power. A chirped pulse enables high range resolution because its form is exactly specified and its echo is a reversed and weakened copy. The reflection has the same shape as the emitted signal, it\u2019s just flipped and has a much smaller amplitude. The two are compared in what is called a matched filter process. The known structure of the emitted pulse is compared to the echo at various locations. A calculation is performed, and if they are misaligned the result of this calculation is zero. At the exact location where they match there is a strong signal that indicates the match. A synthetic pulse that is narrow in range replaces the spread-out pulse (Figure 13). Figure 13: Range Compression The width of the compressed pulse is based entirely on the bandwidth of the emitted pulse. The slant range resolution equation is transformed: \\[ \\delta_{slant\\ range\\ chirp\\ compressed} = \\frac{c}{2B} \\] This is a really beautiful equation. It is so simple and powerful. Resolution in range is entirely based on how much bandwidth we impart to chirped pulses, and like its azimuth counterpart it has nothing whatsoever to do with distance to the ground.","title":"Fixing Range Resolution by Synthesizing a Short Pulse"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/rangeResolution/#slant-range-resolution-examples","text":"So how much can we vary pulse frequency?

Instead, a \u201csynthetic\u201d aperture can be created from a small antenna and a linear extent of recording locations. Figure 7 shows a radar antenna sequentially emitting a series of pulses, like a microwave strobe light, and recording the echoes from a string of receive positions. Figure 7: Linear Extent of Recording Locations In the SAR technique all of the measurements are stored and later processed together. It is as if they were collected from one long antenna equal in length to the extent of the sensor locations that received the echoes. Synthetic Aperture Radar is a post-processing scheme applied to data collected by a standard radar antenna and receiver. Stripmap and Spotlight Apertures There are a few methods to illuminate the ground in SAR imaging. These collection modes trade off resolution and coverage in different ways. To establish how we can simulate long apertures we\u2019ll contrast the two most common forms of SAR imaging: stripmap and spotlight. In stripmap mode the pulses are sent out at a constant angle, usually broadside to the flight direction. In this case, the length of this simulated aperture ( \\(L\\) ) is the same as the width of the beam on the ground (Figure 8). Wider beams produced by smaller antennas mean longer apertures and better azimuth resolution. This directly contrasts with the real-aperture radar of SLAR where the beam was kept as narrow as possible to obtain good resolution. Figure 8: Stripmap Synthetic Aperture The spotlight form of SAR varies the boresight angle in the azimuth direction to illuminate a fixed ground location (Figure 9). This technique greatly increases the synthetic-aperture length and offers excellent azimuth resolution, at the cost of limited ground coverage. At ICEYE we are capable of illuminating a fixed spot for as long as 30 seconds. Given the velocity of low-earth orbits (7.5 km/sec), this yields a synthetic aperture more than 225 kilometers long ! Figure 9: Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Phase History Data and SAR Azimuth Resolution We can create long \u201csynthetic\u201d apertures because radar illumination is coherent. That is, the sensor controls the structure of the transmitted pulses and they all have the same form. It emits pulses and measures the details of each echo: time, strength and \u201cphase\u201d. Phase refers to the position of the wave in its cycle, denoting whether it is at its peak, trough or somewhere in between. The SAR antenna moves only slightly from pulse to pulse. It turns out that the change in location must be less than one-half the antenna length. But this small change in location causes the successive measurements of the range to some object to change as well. The slight change in position imparts a slight change in range. Since the phase is dependent on the range, the small change in adjacent sensor locations also imparts a slight change in phase. These phase changes form a pattern across the aperture, which changes depending on the azimuth location of a ground feature. The record of all the changing phases for all the scatterers in the scene is called phase history data. For a particular object, this is the \u201chistory\u201d of how phase changed from one receive location to the next. Given carefully measured sensor locations, the phase histories for each location across the scene are predictable. The azimuth position of each scatterer can be calculated by comparing the predicted phase pattern of some location to the measured phase history pattern for that point. This is the essence of azimuth resolution. Phase history data and their reference patterns are compared to discriminate the azimuth position of scatterers in the scene. Now that we have that huge aperture and the equation for azimuth resolution becomes: \\[ \\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] where \\(\\delta_{az}\\) is the SAR azimuth resolution. This equation is gorgeous. It says that azimuth resolution is based on the wavelength of our radar waves and the change in the integration angle ( \\(\\Delta \\theta\\) ) while the point was being imaged (Figure 10). Resolution improves when the wavelength is small and the integration angle change is large. Figure 10: Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Angle Now let\u2019s use SAR with an integration angle change of 0.07 radians (4.5\u00b0). This is reasonable because the current operational performance of ICEYE's spotlight mode can easily exceed this angle. \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\Delta \\theta} \\] \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{3 cm}{2 \\times 0.07} \\] \\[\\delta_{az} = 0.21m \\] For stripmap mode the azimuth resolution equation reduces to a simpler form, where \\(D_A\\) is the length of the antenna in the azimuth direction: \\[\\delta_{az} = \\frac{D_A}{2} \\] This is just a special stripmap case of the more general equation, but it seems to imply that we could make the antenna really small to achieve good stripmap resolution. While this is literally true, the small size of the antenna would lessen the total power that could be transmitted and also degrade the ability to record the weak backscattered echoes. Noise would increase significantly. It would also require the PRF to get unreasonably large because a pulse is required at least every one-half antenna length. Stripmap cannot support high-resolution SAR. For that we need to steer the beam during illumination to increase the synthetic aperture, as with a spotlight collection. This mode is capable of fine resolution and it can use a larger, and therefore more powerful and sensitive antenna. Something Is Missing These elegant equations are an astonishing statement about resolution, but it is even more amazing when we consider what is missing. Notice that the SAR azimuth resolution equations do not include a term for distance. Use it on an aircraft or move it all the way out into space, and azimuth resolution does not change. Of course, distance does impact signal strength. When the sensor is further away, the signal strength weakens dramatically and this poses serious challenges to the SAR imaging process. We will not discuss this issue in this overview, but we can say here that radar antennas are very sensitive. Spaceborne SARs successfully record very weak backscatters.","title":"The Remarkable Story Of SAR"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/remarkableStory/#the-remarkable-story-of-synthetic-aperture-radar","text":"","title":"The Remarkable Story of Synthetic Aperture Radar"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/remarkableStory/#improving-azimuth-resolution-by-synthesizing-a-long-antenna","text":"It takes a long antenna to create narrow radar beams, but the aperture itself does not have to be a giant physical antenna.

The first part of the processing flow is called Phase History Processing because it accounts for the changes over time of the phase values of each scatterer. Phase history data are focused into the azimuth and range components of each resolution cell to produce an image product called a \u201ccomplex image\u201d (Figure 15). Figure 15: The SAR Processing Flow and Its Products The Complex Image Info By the way, you will hear SAR engineers refer to the two parameters of a complex image as \u201cIn-Phase\u201d and \u201cQuadrature\u201d. These are just another way to describe the complex values. The left image in Figure 16 is a ICEYE amplitude image of agricultural fields. In this image each pixel has a brightness value assigned to it. This is what many people consider to be the base SAR product, but this is really only half of the full image. The SAR processor calculates the average phase value for each pixel as well. The matching \u201cphase image\u201d of that same scene is on the right in the figure. The combination of these two images is called a complex image, in which every pixel has amplitude and phase values. We use the term \u201ccomplex\u201d because the pixels are described by a mathematical construct called a complex number, where every number has two components. Figure 16: Amplitude and Phase Structure of a Complex Image Of course, phase data are not useful for direct human interpretation. And while they may look like random noise, phase pixels are a unique and valuable aspect of SAR imaging. Phase data can be used to manipulate the synthetic aperture in different ways to extract useful information that is not available from amplitude images. Moreover, changes in the phase measurements of the same object on different images can be used to detect small surface structure characteristics. In the next section we\u2019ll discuss how we can use phase data to refine images and create other products. SAR Products Derived from Complex Data Amplitude Images Info You should also be aware that an engineering calculation called \u201cdetection\u201d converts in-phase and quadrature values to amplitude values. Engineers often refer to SAR amplitude images as \u201cdetected\u201d images. An amplitude image is certainly the most common SAR product, but you need to appreciate that this image is produced for human viewing and analysis. It is not the core image product. Amplitude images do not contain any phase information. Furthermore, the version of the amplitude image used for human viewing is not a direct copy of the amplitude values in a complex image. This is because radar sensors record an enormous span of brightness levels for each complex pixel. The maximum intensity of amplitude in a complex image is usually more than 100,000 times (50 dB) the minimum intensity, and for the best-quality images with bright targets, it is much greater. ICEYE images are produced with 16 bits of dynamic range per pixel (65536 gray levels) but even this is not sufficient to record the full dynamic range of SAR. As valuable as they are, amplitude images have no phase data and they lose much of the dynamic range of complex pixels. You can imagine the growing potential for computers and algorithms to process those complex pixels in ways the human visual system cannot. Multi-look Amplitude Images One way in which we can use complex data is to produce different versions of the seemingly simple amplitude image. One common form of an amplitude image, for example, is called a multi-look image. Consider that azimuth and range resolution are handled independently. One is based on the length of the synthetic aperture and the other is based on the signal bandwidth, and sometimes these are quite different in magnitude. It is common for azimuth resolution to be collected at a higher fidelity than range resolution. If a full-resolution image were produced from such data it would look compressed in range. To view the image in a more natural aspect we need to \u201csquare the pixels\u201d so that the range and azimuth scales are the same. Info Speckle is a grainy, noise-like feature of SAR images. It is caused by the coherent nature of SAR illumination. The reflections from small scatterers within a resolution cell combine constructively and destructively to brighten or darken the returns. This is done by manipulating the synthetic aperture into smaller sub-apertures and then combining them. The sub-apertures are called \u201clooks\u201d and they each produce an image with lower azimuth resolution. This may sound disappointing, but when these individual sub-aperture images are combined, they form a multi-look image in which the noisy effect of speckle is reduced. Complex images are stored at full-resolution and are called single-look complex (SLC) images. Amplitude images are typically multi-looked in azimuth using two to 12 sub-apertures. If range resolution exceeds azimuth resolution a similar multi-look process can be applied in the range dimension. Sub-aperture Stack or Video Image Suppose we take the aperture splitting further and create six or seven segments to produce multiple sub-aperture images. One advantage of this sub-aperture stack is that it can indicate glints that are bright in only a portion of the full aperture. This signature might be washed out on the full-resolution image by the bulk of the aperture in which there was no glinting, but it can be very noticeable in one of the low-resolution sub-apertures. Glints tend to be important signatures because they are usually caused by human-made features. We could even loop the stack like a short movie, or SAR video image, to look for such glints and moving objects. This product works best for long spotlight exposures of ten seconds or more. Amplitude and Coherent Change Detection Perhaps the most useful SAR products are the amplitude and coherent change detection images (ACD, CCD). Two or more images of the same site are collected at different times to detect scene changes. For ACD only the brightness values are compared, while CCD uses phase data. In order for change detection to work, the images have to be collected from nearly the same location in space with similar illumination geometries. For ACD the two images can be overlaid in the complementary colors (eg red and cyan). In this way, features with similar backscatters will be gray, but features with backscatters that changed during the imaging period will appear in one of the two colors. It is conventional for the first image to be displayed in red and the second in cyan. If something on the ground changes between the two collections you will see whichever color signature is dominant. A mnemonic is used to help interpret ACD products: \u201cRed is fled. Blue is new\u201d. That is, a red signature indicates a feature that was present on the first image but left the scene prior to the second image, and a blue signature indicates a feature that appears only on the second image. This mnemonic is an easy way to help remember the order of the images, but appreciate that the second image is actually cyan, not blue. The intentional sloppiness of the mnemonic is acceptable here because verbal precision would ruin the rhyme. In contrast to amplitude change detection, CCD compares the phase values of two nearly identical images taken at different times. CCD is far more sensitive to changes because it is based on phase differences rather than pixel brightness differences and, as we know, phase is measured to within a small fraction of a wavelength. The collection constraints to ensure image-to-image coherence are tighter for CCD than ACD. When the collection parameters are nearly identical, the phase values are also nearly identical, and any changes are due to backscatter differences at a scale of less than one wavelength. It is typical for CCD images to display pixels where phase is consistent in white and the pixels where the phase has changed are dark. These are areas where the two images have \u201cdecorrelated\u201d, or lost phase consistency, due to some subtle change in the scene. Other Multi-image SAR Products The amplitude and phase data of SAR images can be combined to produce other useful products that are too numerous to describe in detail in this overview. These include digital elevation models derived from pixel brightness values or phase data, millimeter-level surface motion measurements derived phase comparisons of sets of matching images, and automated detections of ships, oil spills and other features. Once constellations of small SARs are established it will be possible to monitor any site in the world with large stacks of exactly matching images whose consistent signatures are linked to known ground features. These images could be collected within hours of each other and they will be the basis of intelligent site monitoring services that will not only detect changes, but which will also say what has changed and how it has changed.","title":"SAR Processing Overview"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#sar-processing-overview","text":"","title":"SAR Processing Overview"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#the-sar-processing-flow-and-its-products","text":"SAR image generation begins with the emission of thousands of coherent pulses and the decomposition of each echo into raw measurements of time, amplitude and phase.

This may sound disappointing, but when these individual sub-aperture images are combined, they form a multi-look image in which the noisy effect of speckle is reduced. Complex images are stored at full-resolution and are called single-look complex (SLC) images. Amplitude images are typically multi-looked in azimuth using two to 12 sub-apertures. If range resolution exceeds azimuth resolution a similar multi-look process can be applied in the range dimension.","title":"Multi-look Amplitude Images"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#sub-aperture-stack-or-video-image","text":"Suppose we take the aperture splitting further and create six or seven segments to produce multiple sub-aperture images. One advantage of this sub-aperture stack is that it can indicate glints that are bright in only a portion of the full aperture. This signature might be washed out on the full-resolution image by the bulk of the aperture in which there was no glinting, but it can be very noticeable in one of the low-resolution sub-apertures. Glints tend to be important signatures because they are usually caused by human-made features. We could even loop the stack like a short movie, or SAR video image, to look for such glints and moving objects. This product works best for long spotlight exposures of ten seconds or more.","title":"Sub-aperture Stack or Video Image"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#amplitude-and-coherent-change-detection","text":"Perhaps the most useful SAR products are the amplitude and coherent change detection images (ACD, CCD). Two or more images of the same site are collected at different times to detect scene changes. For ACD only the brightness values are compared, while CCD uses phase data. In order for change detection to work, the images have to be collected from nearly the same location in space with similar illumination geometries. For ACD the two images can be overlaid in the complementary colors (eg red and cyan). In this way, features with similar backscatters will be gray, but features with backscatters that changed during the imaging period will appear in one of the two colors. It is conventional for the first image to be displayed in red and the second in cyan. If something on the ground changes between the two collections you will see whichever color signature is dominant. A mnemonic is used to help interpret ACD products: \u201cRed is fled. Blue is new\u201d. That is, a red signature indicates a feature that was present on the first image but left the scene prior to the second image, and a blue signature indicates a feature that appears only on the second image. This mnemonic is an easy way to help remember the order of the images, but appreciate that the second image is actually cyan, not blue. The intentional sloppiness of the mnemonic is acceptable here because verbal precision would ruin the rhyme. In contrast to amplitude change detection, CCD compares the phase values of two nearly identical images taken at different times. CCD is far more sensitive to changes because it is based on phase differences rather than pixel brightness differences and, as we know, phase is measured to within a small fraction of a wavelength. The collection constraints to ensure image-to-image coherence are tighter for CCD than ACD. When the collection parameters are nearly identical, the phase values are also nearly identical, and any changes are due to backscatter differences at a scale of less than one wavelength. It is typical for CCD images to display pixels where phase is consistent in white and the pixels where the phase has changed are dark. These are areas where the two images have \u201cdecorrelated\u201d, or lost phase consistency, due to some subtle change in the scene.","title":"Amplitude and Coherent Change Detection"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/sarProcessing/#other-multi-image-sar-products","text":"The amplitude and phase data of SAR images can be combined to produce other useful products that are too numerous to describe in detail in this overview. These include digital elevation models derived from pixel brightness values or phase data, millimeter-level surface motion measurements derived phase comparisons of sets of matching images, and automated detections of ships, oil spills and other features. Once constellations of small SARs are established it will be possible to monitor any site in the world with large stacks of exactly matching images whose consistent signatures are linked to known ground features. These images could be collected within hours of each other and they will be the basis of intelligent site monitoring services that will not only detect changes, but which will also say what has changed and how it has changed.","title":"Other Multi-image SAR Products"},{"location":"OverviewOfSAR/simpleFormOfImaging/","text":"A Simple Form of Radar Imaging As seen in Figure 1 the radar antenna emits a series of pulses toward the ground where they are scattered in many directions. The sensor records the \u201cbackscatter\u201d, which is the portion reflected toward the antenna. It measures the strength of the echo and the time it took for the pulse to travel to the ground and back. Figure 1: Pulse Transmission and Backscatter Signal strength corresponds to pixel brightness and the timing provides range information. The range is one-half the total travel time. In the equation below, \\(\\Delta T\\) is the travel time and \\(c\\) is the speed of light: \\[Range = \\frac{\\Delta T\\ c}{2}\\] Side-Looking Illumination Since the pixels of a radar imaging system are placed on the image based partly on their range, the antenna cannot illuminate the ground in a vertical orientation. If it did, features on the same imaging line at equivalent angles off nadir would have identical ranges, like the two purple diamonds in Figure 2, and they would occupy the same pixel location. Figure 2: Vertical Illumination Radar imaging must be side-looking so that ground points from the near to far range have different range values (Figure 3). The illumination is typically broadside, or perpendicular, to the flight direction. Figure 3: Side-Looking Illumination Radar Angles The angles associated with radar illumination are shown in Figure 4, which is based on a spherical earth surface. Most radar imaging is broadside to the flight direction, but some systems can collect off-broadside in a squinted orientation. The angle down from the local level at the sensor is called the depression angle. The angle between the line-of-sight ray and the local vertical is the incidence angle. The angle between the tangent to the surface and the line of sight is the grazing angle. Note that the incidence and grazing angles are complements in that they form a right angle when combined. This means that a 60\u00b0 incidence angle is the same as a 30\u00b0 grazing angle. Figure 4: Radar Imaging Angles Side Looking Airborne Radar The first useful radar imaging technique was a form called Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) (Figure 5). The image is built up via the forward motion of the antenna, one line at a time. The pulses are emitted at a rate called the pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which can range from a few hundred pulses each second for airborne systems to thousands each second for spacecraft. In the SLAR technique, the individual pulses create each image line. The angular width of the pulse on the ground along the direction of flight, or azimuth direction, determines one component of resolution. The range measurements are collected in the \u201cslant range\u201d direction, and range variations to different objects form the second dimension of resolution. Figure 5: Side-Looking Airborne Radar SLAR was used the early days of radar imaging but it had serious limitations. Range resolution was one-half the length of the pulse in the range direction. Since the pulses are emitted at light speed, even a very brief pulse of one-millionth of a second would be 300 meters long and produce range resolution of 150 meters (Figure 6). Azimuth resolution was based on the angular width of the pulse in the azimuth direction ( \\(\\beta\\) ). Long antennas create narrow beams, but the beam spreads out from the antenna to the distant ground surface. Antennas cannot be made long enough to produce good azimuth resolution, and SLAR produced images with resolutions in the hundreds of meters, even from aircraft. This is why the brilliant concept of synthesizing a long antenna from the actions of a small one was developed. We call this Synthetic Aperture Radar.

From here the process of image formation is performed. The focussing algorithm used depends on the acquisition type. The data is then stored and represented as binary data in a container file format ready for exploitation. During the development of the final exploitable product several decisions have to be made about the data representation. At ICEYE we realise that not every format is suitable for every customer or use case so starting in 2022 we will be increasing the range of processing options available. To start with a discussion on the possibilities is warrented so that later we can refer to our current formats in context of the larger landscape. The Tree of Processing Options There are many steps that have to be considered when converting RADAR pulse data into an exploitable image. Here we will talk about each in turn. Sample Arrangement This is the way the image pixels are aligned as a ' raster ' in the container file. Most GIS viewers will convert the projection for you on your screen. Map-oriented images are larger than range-azimuth images as the rotation to make the image 'north-up' in the container file requires the addition of blank pixels to make the image rectangular. Despite this some users prefer to view the map-oriented product as its map representation with north up and east right makes it easier to use with with paper-based maps. Axis Alignment Another file representation option is the alignment of axes in the binary data. Range-azimuth data can be aligned shadows down or aziumuth down . Modern GIS viewers can display the data in any representation and easily convert between the two. Scientists using algorithms to exploit the data need to understand the data represention though and it needs to be consistent. Historically imagery intelligence analysts are used to using fine resolution imagery to observe subtle features on small objects of interest. In theses situations it is more important to have a consistent alignment of shadows, multipath and layover of an object than to know where north is. For large-scale mapping, azimuth down easily allows a collection to be extended by concatenating more data to the end of a file. Projection The orientation of the focussed resolution cells in 3D space is the projection. Most commonly this is the slant plane or the ground plane but the projection can have any orientation and even be in the form of a curve or a more complex surface. There are many reasons for a user prefering one projection over another, usually related to how the imagery will be exploited, but it should be recognised that the slant plane is the most efficient and artefact free focus projection. Number of Looks The number of looks allows a trade to be made between finer resolution and better signal to noise ratio. A single look has the finest resolution. Symetric IPR averages the requied number of looks to make a circular impulse response (circular 2D resolution). Complex Samples Each sample starts life as a complex number. This is usually as an in-phase ( I ) and quadrature ( Q ) pair but it can also be represented as amplitude and phase which saves a user some time if they want to look at only the amplitude data. The process of calculating the amplitude is called ' detection ' which is the 'D' in ' Ground Range Detected ' (GRD). The number of shades of grey that a pixel in a SAR image can have is determined by the binary representation of that pixel. As very few pixels are very bright or very dark it is often convenient to store the SAR image data as an unsigned integer - typically uint8 or uint16 format- designed to span the majority of the grey-scale values. This reduces the data size of the image and is useful for most tasks. Sometimes however, it is important to be able to discriminate between different kinds of very bright or dark pixel values (for example man-made objects in trees or ocean wave structure on a calm ocean). In these situations a floating point representation is more useful. Container Format The container and file format defines how the data and associated metadata is stored on disk. It also defines which image viewers know how to read the data.

Usually this is only one beam but Scan products use multiple beams to image different ranges (at the cost of reduced resolution) Nominal Swath Width: The actual image size will be slightly larger than this to guarantee that the tasked area is covered. Nominal Swath Length: The actual image length may be slightly larger to guarantee that the tasked area is covered. The maximum value can vary from satellite to satellite due to power/data/thermal limitations. Maximum Collection Duration/Length: Spot images do not have a maximum collection duration as they image for the required amount of time to obtain a tasked azimuth resolution. For Strip and Scan modes the maximum collection duration (and therefore the maximum image length) is limited by the amount of on-board memory storage or satellite thermal limitations. As different incidence angles have different slant range resolutions in order to provide the same ground range resolution, then the maximum collection duration is also a function of incidence angle. NESZ: The noise equivalent sigma zero values are taken at scene center for near and far range extents. Slant Range Resolution: For Strip mode the transmitted bandwidth is varied to make sure that the resolution on the ground remains the same. For Spot mode the maximum bandwidth is transmitted at all times. RNIIRS: Radar National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale is a subjective assessment of Radar Image Quality used primarily by military analysts. The scale is from 0 (\" interpretability of the imagery is precluded by obscuration, degradation, or very poor resolution \") to the highest quality figure of merit, 10 \\cite{rniirs}. RGIQE: This is the Radar General Image Quality Equation. It is an adaptation of the concept of a General Image Quality Equation \\cite{leachtenauer1997general} Developed by NGA . Unlike the RNIIRS scale which is a largely subjective assessment of image quality, the RGIQE uses maximum channel capacity (measured in bits of information) as a figure of merit. From the Shannon-Hartley Theorem \\cite{shannon1984communication} the maximum information that can be carried in a signal (conventionally called a channel due to the origins in communications) is given by : \\[ C = B \\log_2\\left(1+\\frac{S}{N}\\right) \\] Where \\(C\\) is measured in bits per second, \\(B\\) is the bandwidth of the system and \\(\\frac{S}{N}\\) is the signal to noise ratio. Recognising that a resolution cell in a SAR image is ultimately defined in range by the transmitted bandwidth and in azimuth by the Doppler bandwidth, a measure of the maximum information content of a resolution cell in bits/ \\(m^2\\) can be formulated : \\[ I = B_{az} B_{R_{ground}} \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{S}{N}\\right) \\] Where \\(I\\) is the information content measured in bits/ \\(m^2\\) , \\(B_{az}\\) is the Doppler bandwidth used to form the azimuth extent of a pixel and \\(B_{R_{ground}}\\) is the range bandwidth in the ground plane used to form the range extent of a pixel. The noise in this case is made up from all the noise elements that contribute to reduced image quality in the final image (Thermal noise, quantization noise, sidelobes, ambiguities). In this scale the higher the figure then the more 'information' is available for exploitation within the pixel. Complex Dynamic Range: A complex number with 16bit I and 16bit Q values Amplitude Dynamic Range: Stored as an unsigned 16 bit integer. Performant Incidence Range: This is the nominal or standard range of incidence angles that the ICEYE Fleet operates over. The parameters in these tables are correct within this range of angles. Time Dominant Incidence Range: Being quite small and agile, and having an electronically steered antenna, ICEYE satellites can collect radar imagery from a wide range of angles. Outside of the Performant Incidence Range , SAR image quality may be degraded. However in some situations it may be more important to obtain a SAR image quickly rather than wait for an opportunity to image the location with the performant range of angles. For this reason ICEYE offers time dominant tasking as either a Tactical or a Custom order. References V. Amans B. Hoersch.

RPCs link image locations to ground locations via simple equations that enable rapid calculations. In addition to ease and speed, RPC coefficients have the further advantage of being sensor independent. The structure of the RPC equations is always the same. For this reason, RPC exploitation code does not have to change to accommodate different sensors. In fact, both optical and SAR sensors are modeled by the same RPC structure. Exploitation code that performs geolocation for images from optical sensors can actually be used to derive ground locations from the RPC data included with ICEYE complex and amplitude images. This process is now commonplace in most geospatial viewers (we recommend using QGIS 1 and it is freely available for analysts and software developers.) Info Image geolocation of any mono image, optical or SAR, requires that an elevation model be used during exploitation. This is true for the physics-based equations and RPCs. Single Look Complex (SLC) Product These are full-resolution, single-look images of the focused SAR signals. Scenes are stored in the satellite\u2019s native image acquisition geometry, which is the slant-range-by-azimuth imaging plane. As shown in the green surface in Figure ??, the pixels are aligned perpendicular to the sensor flight track (The pixels have zero-Doppler SAR coordinates}). They are spaced equidistant in azimuth and in slant range. Each pixel contains both amplitude and phase information as represented by a complex magnitude value with in-phase and quadrature components (I & Q). Figure 2: Slant range and ground range image geometry SLC products are suitable for applications that rely on phase information or require the full image resolution. Because SLC images are in the native sensor orientation, there are no radiometric artefacts induced by the spatial resampling applied to map projection images. The range-azimuth orientation also enables further geometric manipulation, like orthorectification. Ortho versions can be produced using both commercial and free software tools, such as the European\u2019s Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel Application Platform (ESA SNAP S1TBX 2 ). The SLC product is particularly useful for those analysts who require multiple collections with matching phase data for applications like Coherent Change Detection (CCD). SLC images are typically used by scientists and organisations with advanced SAR expertise, but complex images will become core products for numerous users once SAR applications become more user-friendly. Amplitude Image Note When mapping an image from the slant plane to the ground, the average elevation of the scene is applied to the ellipsoid used in the projection. These are viewable forms of SAR data used for analyst exploitation; the pixels have brightness values but no phase data. Amplitude images are multi-looked to reduce the salt-and-pepper effect of speckle. The images are also projected from the slant plane onto an ellipsoid model of the ground surface (See Figure 2). The resulting product has approximately square spatial resolution and equal pixel spacing. It also has reduced speckle, due to the multi-look processing. Figure 3 illustrates slant range and ground range projections of amplitude pixels. The pixel's dimensions are equal in range and azimuth in the ground projection on the right. As with SLC images, sensor-oriented amplitude images maintain the native sensor geometry of range and azimuth and no image rotation to a map coordinate system has been performed. This avoids interpolation artefacts and it supports image stacking for change detection applications and physics-based, rigorous geolocation. ICEYE images can be viewed using open standard GIS readers such as QGIS 1 . We do not orthorectify our amplitude images or project them to an ellipsoid-based map projection, but we provide information, which can be quickly applied by users to their ICEYE imagery using freeware software, available on the market.

Figure 1: ICEYE Generation 2 Satellite The following describes the current fleet and their orbital configuration.

This means that the time to revisit a location on the equator varies over a period of days. The mean revisit rate at the equator is 20 hours and the mean time to access a location on the equator is 12 hours. At higher and lower latitudes, the rates are more frequent. Table 2 lists the orbital parameters of the current SAR instruments. Each satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit with 15 revolutions per day. Their ground track repeat cycles vary between 1 and 22 days, depending on the satellite. Each orbital plane is phased around the Earth with a different local time of the ascending node (LTAN). This means that the overall constellation can observe a location at different times of the day. This has an advantage over dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbits, in which the local time of collection is always close to sunrise or sunset.

Adjustment is usually performed in the orbital plane by raising or lowering the satellite's altitude. This changes the orbital period, which in turn changes the ground track repeat period. Over the next 12 months, the fleet will gradually be adjusted into one-day repeating coherent ground tracks. This provides novel opportunities to combine data collections of the same area whilst maintaining rapid access times. The location of each ICEYE satellite is publicly available. The current configuration of the constellation can be found using the satellite catalog numbers in Table 2 and one of the excellent online orbital elements tools such as celestrak 1 or n2yo 2 , which provides a live view of the current ICEYE constellation.

Table 2 lists the orbital parameters of the current SAR instruments. Each satellite is in a sun-synchronous orbit with 15 revolutions per day. Their ground track repeat cycles vary between 1 and 22 days, depending on the satellite. Each orbital plane is phased around the Earth with a different local time of the ascending node (LTAN). This means that the overall constellation can observe a location at different times of the day. This has an advantage over dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbits, in which the local time of collection is always close to sunrise or sunset. Orbit Parameters Nominal Altitude 560 to 580 km Orbit Parameters Value Inclination 97.7\u00b0 (sun-synchronous) Orbits / Day 15 Ground track repeat 1 - 22 days Constellation mean revisit at equator 20 hours Constellation mean time to access at equator 12 hours Nodal crossing (LTAN) 22:30, 15:05, 14:04, 21:36 Satellite Catalog Numbers 43800,44390,46497,46496,47510,47506 Orbit maintenance Ion Propulsion Table 2: Constellation Parameters Each satellite has the ability to slowly adjust their orbits throughout their operating life. Adjustment is usually performed in the orbital plane by raising or lowering the satellite's altitude. This changes the orbital period, which in turn changes the ground track repeat period. Over the next 12 months, the fleet will gradually be adjusted into one-day repeating coherent ground tracks. This provides novel opportunities to combine data collections of the same area whilst maintaining rapid access times. The location of each ICEYE satellite is publicly available. The current configuration of the constellation can be found using the satellite catalog numbers in Table 2 and one of the excellent online orbital elements tools such as celestrak 1 or n2yo 2 , which provides a live view of the current ICEYE constellation.","title":"Orbits"},{"location":"productguide/fleet/#references","text":"T.S.

This section describes the tasking process for new ICEYE collections and how to order archived imagery from ICEYE\u2019s catalog. ICEYE Tasking To make things easier for customers we have a simple tasking process for new images based on standard imaging configurations and simple time windows ( Standard Orders ). This provides the quickest and simplest way to order SAR imagery. More sophisticated requests can be placed using a Custom Order . Standard Orders ICEYE Tasking Standard Orders are based on the concept of acquisition time windows . When placing an order, the customer specifies a list of timing requirements that define one or more time windows in which the desired images should be acquired. This allows ICEYE to confirm that the images will be acquired during the specified time windows, without the need for the customer to review a preliminary feasibility study with exact acquisition times. Figure 4: Example of a single image order with an acquisition time window of 2 days. This order specifies that the image should be collected anytime between 4-October-2021 00:00 and 6-October-2021 00:00 Figure 5: Example of an order for a stack of images with a repeat cycle of 20 days and an acquisition time window for each image of 14 days. Standard orders are submitted via email. To order, please fill out the Standard Order Form with your contact information, and be sure to specify all the required tasking options described in the paragraphs below. Once completed, please send your Standard Order Form and the optional AOI file to the email address customer@iceye.com . Info The order form will be provided by COSP. If you need a new one please email customer@iceye.com Figure 6: Standard ICEYE Tasking order flow The named recipients for that order will be notified via email once the order is received by the ICEYE Customer Operations and Satellite Planning (COSP) team. Once received, your order will be ingested into the ICEYE's planning system which will determine if the order can be confirmed within the AOI, and time windows that you have requested for the AOI. If the order can be fulfilled, you will be notified via email that your order has been accepted and the images will be scheduled for acquisition. If the order cannot be fulfilled in time, you will be notified via email that your order cannot be completed. Please note that standard orders require no final confirmation from you. If your order is accepted, the images will be acquired and delivered to you. After an order is confirmed, ICEYE will make sure that your images are acquired, downlinked, processed, quality controlled and delivered to you. The exact acquisition times are determined by the acquisition time window size that you chose when placing your order. How to fill in a standard order form When placing a Standard Order you will need to specify and/or select from the following options available in the Imagery Order Form : AOI : The Area of Interest in the form of a latitude/longitude pair in the WGS 84 coordinate system. Alternatively, you can include a KML/KMZ, or geojson file as an attachment to your order. Timing information : Start and End time for the order : This is the time range in which the order is valid. Acquisition time windows size : Choose a time window size according to the precision that you require for each of the images that should be acquired. Basic: Each image is acquired within a 14-day time window from your specified order start time and repeat cycle .This time window size is ideal for non-time-critical monitoring applications that do not require precise acquisition times. Pro: Each image is acquired within a 2-day time window from your specified order start time and repeat cycle. This is our base level service, commonly used in applications that do not depend on exact acquisition times or geometries. Exact: Each image is acquired within a 2-hour time window from your specified order start time and repeat cycle. This is our premium service, tailored for time-critical collections that do not depend on the customer requiring a precise imaging geometry. Note that for Exact time window size, you can optionally include an attachment with your desired exact acquisition times. This attachment can be the result of a feasibility study that you had previously requested or it can be generated directly by you using our published satellite ephemerides. Please see the section Optional Feasibility Studies below. Repeat cycle : This is the time between the start of consecutive acquisition time windows. This information is only required for orders of image stacks (repeat acquisitions). Acquisition type : Select whether you want a Single acquisition of the specified AOI Stack of images of the same AOI over a time period Imaging Mode : Refer to Section~\\ref{sec:TypesOfCollection} for more information on these imaging modes Strip Spot Scan Feasibility Study as Part of a Standard Order At any time, when considering placing an ICEYE Tasking standard order you can request a feasibility study by emailing customer@iceye.com . You will need to provide an AOI, an imaging mode (or resolution), a time period and any possible additional instructions that you may require. The ICEYE Customer Operations and Satellite Planning Team will respond with a list of acquisition opportunities. Please note that Feasibility Studies are for informational purposes and do not reserve constellation capacity for the opportunities reported. The required constellation capacity to fulfill an order under the agreed time window size is only reserved after ICEYE confirms an order . Please also note that feasibility studies are not required to place a standard order. You can eliminate the need for a feasibility study by accurately describing the time windows and other acquisition constraints that match your actual needs as part of your standard order. Figure 7: Feasibility studies can be requested before placing a standard order. Sometimes you might like to perform your own feasibility studies and we encourage this. We have made sure our satellite ephemeris information is publicly available at celestrak [^1] and n2yo.com [^2], and have provided step by step instructions on how to use the Swath Acquisition Viewer Software, SaVoir on the ICEYE website . Let us know how well this works for you. Custom Orders Custom Tasking orders offer a higher level of flexibility when specifying tasking requirements you desire. In general, any options that are not available as part of standard order can be requested as part of a custom order. Custom orders are initiated by submitting a Custom Order Form via email to customer@iceye.com . Our tasking experts will study the feasibility of your request and will quote an acquisition plan for you to approve. The following are examples of options that are currently available as part of a custom order: Mosaics : Coverage of large areas by acquiring multiple images Custom AOI coverage requirements : Each acquired image must cover at least a minimum percentage of the area of interest. Local time deviation limits : Images belonging to a stack or mosaic collection should be acquired within a certain local time range. Long image size requirements : Images that exceed the standard frame size of the requested imaging mode to cover the desired AOI. For example, long Strip acquisitions. Azimuth angle deviation limits for stacks or mosaics : Images belonging to a stack or mosaic collection should be acquired within a certain azimuth angle range. Custom acquisition time windows not available as standard tasking options : For example 72-hour, or 96-hour time windows for each acquisition. Our tasking experts will be happy to try to accommodate any special tasking request that is required to meet your business needs. Figure 8: Custom ICEYE Tasking order flow. Quality Control and Image Delivery The processed data will be assessed during the Quality Control process. An ICEYE image analyst will verify that the frame contains the customer\u2019s target location, that it complies to the product specifications and that it does not contain any disqualifying ambiguities. The frames are delivered to customers via a SFTP server within 8 hours of the data being acquired. ICEYE offers faster delivery times for customers that require near-realtime data. New customers receive instructions from the Customer Operations and Satellite Planning team on how to access your SFTP account. Through the SFTP server, you will have access to download all of your frames. You will receive a notification (via email) every time a new frame has been added to your SFTP account and is ready for you to download. Info Images are stored in your SFTP account for a period of 30 days. Unforeseen Circumstances In very rare situations, it might not be possible to acquire an image within the agreed time window. In this case, the Customer Operations and Satellite Planning team will immediately inform the customer and will propose an extended acquisition time window size or allow the customer to cancel the collection. ICEYE Archive Imagery As an ICEYE customer, you have access to a complete catalog of archive imagery that is available for ordering. This catalog is updated on a regular basis on your SFTP account. The catalog is available in kmz and geojson formats and it includes low resolution image thumbnails so you can get a feel for the content of the image. The archive catalog can be viewed in Google Earth, QGIS or your favorite GIS where you can browse image locations, filter by time or different image metadata and perform advanced searches. Please note that imagery is included in the ICEYE Archive Catalog at least seven days after its acquisition time. Figure 9: Browsing the ICEYE Archive catalog in Google Earth (kmz format). Figure 10: Browsing the ICEYE Archive catalog in QGIS (geojson format). Archive imagery orders can be submitted via email. To place an order, please fill out either the Standard Order Form or the Custom Order Form with your contact information, and include a list of the product names for the scenes that you wish to purchase. An example of a product name that identifies an image scene is : ICEYE_ARCHIVE_SM_10306_20190918T125047 Once an order is received, the ICEYE Customer Success team will deliver the requested images to you within 12 hours. Please note that all orders for archive imagery require no final confirmation from you. The images that you request in your order will be delivered to you. Figure 11: Archive imagery order flow. Please note that orders for archive imagery do not go through additional quality control. However, if you are not satisfied with the quality of an archive image that you have received, you can make use of our return policy described below. Order Cancellation In order to support your evolving business requirements, ICEYE supports a user-friendly order cancellation policy. Cancellation of Tasking Orders Standard Tasking orders confirmed by ICEYE can be cancelled free of charge up to 72 hours prior to the start of the acquisition time window.

Your satisfaction is our priority, so we will work quickly to resolve your concerns. \u0153 Invoicing ICEYE users can pay for imaging in a range of different ways in order to be as flexible as possible: Prepayment : In this option a number of images can be paid for up-front. When the prepayment has been paid, you can place orders and receive the amount of data up to your prepaid quota. This is designed for customers that know that they would like to purchase a number of images and offers imagery at a reduced rate. Net 30 : This is designed for larger or industrial customers wishing to purchase imagery in volume. In this case we will discuss your needs and enter into a contract with you. Images can then be tasked as and when you see fit and we will invoice you monthly. Payment then has to be made within 30 days of sending you the invoice. ICEYE Finance will send invoices during the first week of the month for all the products delivered to the Customer within the previous month. The monthly invoice will not include the products that have been ordered but have not yet been delivered to the Customer. If no products have been shipped to the Customer during the previous month, invoice will not be extended.","title":"Ordering data"},{"location":"productguide/ordering/#ordering-iceye-products","text":"ICEYE offers timely and reliable global SAR imaging.

We do this with our continually growing SAR satellite constellation, currently in orbit and delivering SAR data. This product guide reviews our constellation, products, imaging modes and ordering process. This is a living document because our innovative small SARs are flexible and they welcome our routine upgrades to their resolution, coverage and quality. We\u2019ll release new versions of this guide as we improve our sensors, expand our constellation, and streamline our order and delivery systems. SAR sensors see through clouds and darkness. They measure pulse echoes with a precision much smaller than a single wavelength. Their resolution is independent of distance. They are capable of pristine geolocation, and they are change detection machines. We Look Forward to Serving You The Small SAR Revolution in Earth Imaging During the Middle Ages, if you wanted to understand the way the world worked you would consult your local religious leader. A Priest or Prophet would interpret the Word of God from beautifully written tomes that were transcribed by hand over many years. These books were ornate and so precious that they could not be widely distributed, and most people did not know how to read. In these years, the thoughts of nations were controlled by various religious and political leaders. Then everything changed. The Renaissance and Reformation spurred new ways of thinking, and their ideas were recorded in printed books that were produced at low cost and in great volumes. People learned to read for themselves and think for themselves. Information spread across the globe. Sometimes disruption can be good. Hundreds of years later, in 2012, a small team of students working in the Nanosatellite Group of Aalto University considered the sequestered world of earth observation. The team was bothered by the limitations of government satellite programs in the same way that Renaissance and Reformation advocates challenged the knowledge control of the Middle Ages. Satellite imagery has been mostly provided by massive, government-owned or government-sponsored, exquisite systems. Like the tomes of old, these are beautifully implemented and precious. But normal people rarely have access to their images, and even when they are available, they do not have the timeliness to support the quick decisions needed in this rapidly changing world. The Nanosatellite students thought that timely, always available fine-resolution imagery should become a part of everyday life in the 21st century in the same way that GPS became integrated to nearly all businesses in the last decade of the 20th century. The humanitarian applications of easily-accessible imagery would include earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, glacial flow, and numerous environmental indicators. But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change. Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking. In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters. The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection. We will bring our users access to highly accurate, highly reliable monitoring, whenever and wherever they need it, at a pace that has never before existed.

Satellite imagery has been mostly provided by massive, government-owned or government-sponsored, exquisite systems. Like the tomes of old, these are beautifully implemented and precious. But normal people rarely have access to their images, and even when they are available, they do not have the timeliness to support the quick decisions needed in this rapidly changing world. The Nanosatellite students thought that timely, always available fine-resolution imagery should become a part of everyday life in the 21st century in the same way that GPS became integrated to nearly all businesses in the last decade of the 20th century. The humanitarian applications of easily-accessible imagery would include earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, glacial flow, and numerous environmental indicators. But if earth-observation imagery were to become as available, reliable and timely as the pace of our modern lives requires, things needed to change. Fueled by curiosity, passion, and long, dark Helsinki nights, the students decided that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) would be the most useful way to obtain guaranteed, all-weather, day-night, observations of this cloud-covered planet. They reconsidered the conventional thinking regarding the mass and size needed to build SAR satellites, and then developed experimental sensors to prove and revise their thinking. In 2015 ICEYE Oy was born. And thanks to several backers who shared our vision, on January 12th, 2018 the world\u2019s first micro-SAR satellite was launched. In contrast to the existing SAR systems that each weigh several tons, our ICEYE-X1 weighed only 75kg. It provided beautiful 3-meter resolution imagery, and it allowed our company to evaluate many natural disasters. The ICEYE fleet is now growing rapidly. We began 2021 with 7 satellites, and we\u2019ll expand this to a constellation of 18 by mid-2022. Change is natural to our flexible systems. We upgrade our satellites the way programmers update code. Our resolution and coverage improves with each new version. And our low-cost, low-mass satellites are so highly maneuverable that we can reposition them to optimize revisit rates and support global change detection. We will bring our users access to highly accurate, highly reliable monitoring, whenever and wherever they need it, at a pace that has never before existed.

There are two basic forms of ICEYE images: complex images in the slant plane and amplitude images projected to the ground surface. Details about the formats of these products are provided in 'Product Formats' . Complex Images SAR complex images contain pixels that have both amplitude and phase values. They are produced at full resolution and are projected in the inclined direction of illumination, called the slant plane. Since complex images retain phase information, they can be used to produce numerous SAR products like coherent change detection images and precise surface motion measurements. Amplitude Images These are the familiar SAR gray-scale images with amplitude-only pixels. They are \u201cmulti-looked\u201d to reduce the grainy effect of speckle, at the cost of slightly lower resolution. Amplitude images are projected to the ground surface and can be oriented with respect to the sensor or produced on an ellipsoid-based map projection. For historical reasons our amplitude images are associated with the acronym GRD which stands for Ground Range Detected . This term may change in the future to be something more meaningful. Types of SAR Collection Our first set of satellites operate in one of two primary imaging modes called Strip Mode and Spot Mode. These are available in both right and left-looking configurations. The design flexibility of our satellites allows their imaging modes to be continually evolved. We will be adding more modes, and more flexible illumination patterns, in future versions. A recent addition is the introduction of a wide area imaging capability that utilises electronic beam steering. This is called Scan Mode A summary of the imaging modes is listed in An Overview of SAR Imaging . Strip Mode In this mode the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses while the antenna beam is fixed in its orientation. The beam is pointed off to the side of the satellite at an angle broadside to the satellite flight path. This results in a long image strip parallel to the flight direction. ICEYE standard Strip products have a ground resolution of 3m in range and azimuth and cover an area of 30km (range) by 50km (azimuth). The strip length can be tailored up to a length of 500 km, in increments of 50 km. Spot Mode In Spot mode the radar beam is steered to illuminate a fixed point. This increases the illumination time and therefore increases the length of the synthetic aperture and improves azimuth resolution. Spot mode uses the maximum 300 MHz pulse bandwidth to achieve a 0.5m slant range resolution ( here is an explanation of where this comes from.). ICEYE's standard Spot collection covers an area of 5km x 5km with a ground resolution of 1m and has 4 independent looks that are useful for suppressing speckle effects and increasing the image quality. Alternatively, customers can now request an extended area spot image. This is a standard Spot collection that trades the number of looks to increase the scene size whilst preserving the resolution. The Spot extended area collection has a scene size of 15km x 15km at 1m ground resolution using a single independent look. Scan Mode This mode uses the phased array antenna to create multiple beams in the elevation direction. This beam steering means that points on the ground are not illuminated for as long which reduces the resolution of a Scan product compared to Spot or Strip modes. Conventionally, ground points are illuminated by different parts of the radar beam resulting in brighter and darker regions in the image. We compensate for this by also steering the radar beam sideways during each burst of radar pulses resulting in an overall improvement in image quality. This technique is called Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS or TOPSAR 1 ). Our Scan product produces imagery that covers an area of 100km x 100km with a resolution better than 15m. The length of a Scan product can be increased to 300km. References F. De Zan and A. Monti Guarnieri. Topsar: terrain observation by progressive scans.
