# ICEYE ARCHIVES

Things change fast at ICEYE and we are constantly updating our skills and capabilities as well as our satellites. On this page you will find a collection of our external documents and some links to places that we have found useful when learning about SAR.

## Previous Product Documentation
As we evolve our products, we also have to evolve our metadata and documentation. To allow users to search through previous ICEYE documents we provide them as links in the following table.

## ICEYE Publications
Having such a large SAR constellation provides unique opportunities for scientific reasearch and experimentation. ICEYE encourages its staff to participate in reaseach activities and innovation is a core principal for the company. In the following table are some recent scientific publications that the team has been working on.
