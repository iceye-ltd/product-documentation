| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
|**Azimuth**            |	Direction aligned with the relative spaceborne platform velocity vector. |
|**Detection**	        |Processing step in which the phase information is removed and only the signal amplitude is preserved. Normally the detection uses a magnitude squared method and has units of voltage square per pixel. |
|**Focusing**        |Data processing finalized to focus the SAR image in range and azimuth through bidimensional signal compression.|
|**Ground range**	    |Projection of the slant range into the ground.|
|**Incidence angle**	|Local incidence angle on ground calculated using the ellipsoidal Earth model.|
|**Looks**	            |Image obtained using only part of the spectrum to focus the image (subaperture). It can be done in range and in azimuth, and normally is used to reduce the speckle noise from SAR images through incoherent sum (multi-look process).|
|**Range**	            |Direction orthogonal to the satellite velocity. |
|**Slant range vector**	|Line-Of-Sight distance between the antenna and the target on ground.|
|**Slant range plane**	|Plane containing the relative sensor velocity vector and the slant range vector for a given target.|
|**Geocoded**           | |
|**Georeference**       | |
|**Orthorectification** | |
