## How To Read This Document

We want to make this document useful to a broad range of readers. Some might have heard about ICEYE and want to find out more about the company. Thats what this page is for and we would encourage these people to visit the <a href="http://iceye.com" target=”_blank”>ICEYE website</a> as it has lots of examples and stories about the company, what it has done and where it wants to get to.

Others might be simply interested to learn a bit more about SAR, how it works and what it can be used for. We have a pretty good and easily accessible tutorial on our [How SAR Works](OverviewOfSAR/overviewOfSAR.md) pages.

There will be some people who want to learn more about the data products that ICEYE provides. This is where the [ICEYE Products](productguide/products.md) section comes in. As well as describing our current satellite composition and capabillities it provides descriptions of the kind of images that you might want to buy as well as details of how to get in touch with us and our service commitment that we make to you.

Finally, there will be some who already have ICEYE SAR imagery and want to get the most out of it. This is where the [data format specification](productguide/products.md) comes in. These pages describe ICEYE data products in detail and are intended for use by analysts, researchers and developers to more easily unpack the contents of a SAR scene and its associated metadata. As well as describing the file structure these pages also contain many useful code snippets and links to external tools.

Finally, if you are not quite sure where to find what you are looking for you can just type a short query in the search bar at the top of each page.
