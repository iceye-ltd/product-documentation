We are still putting the final touches in place but we wanted to put something out there early to gather as much feedback as possible from people. If you find a problem or something that you disagree with or don't understand then send me a slack message*

## How To Read This Document

Previously if you wanted to find out about ICEYE satellites or our data we asked you to check out our **Product Guide** in pdf format. [This is still available](https://www.iceye.com/downloads/product-documents) for download but we thought that it wasn't as easy to read or use as a more interactive web-based set of documents. Thats what this site is (and hopefully a bit more).

If you want to learn more about ICEYE the company, its initiatives and projects then we would encourage you to visit the <a href="http://iceye.com" target=”_blank”>ICEYE website</a>. It has many examples and stories about the company, what it has done and where it wants to go.

The list of contents on the left should guide you through the information you need from this site in a sensible order. 

 * Up first is a description of the current [**ICEYE Fleet**](productguide/fleet) of satellites with some useful information on where each satellite is right now.
 * This is followed by a section on [**ICEYE data products**](productguide/products). This is where you can find out about the different types of SAR images you can buy and contains a useful summary of what performance parameters you can expect when you receive your imagery.
 * Once you know what ICEYE data products best support your requirements, you will want to know how to order some imagery. This is covered in the next section on [**Ordering SAR imagery**](productguide/ordering). This section also describes the level of support you can expect to receive.
 * The next section is for those users that want to explore the techical content of their ICEYE SAR imagery. It contains the [**product specification**](productFormats/introduction) for each image product and describes how each imaged is stored and formatted. It also contains details of all the metadata elements stored in ICEYE images. It provides some guides and explanations on some foundation principles related to the practical exploitation of SAR imagery.
 * Following this is a section for those curious to understand [**how SAR works**](OverviewOfSAR/overviewOfSAR.md). SAR truly is an amazing type of imaging sensor with many unique properties that are all too easy to overlook so we pulled this section together to explain the basic principles.
 * The [**last section**](comingsoon) provides a teaser of some of the things we are working on now and expect to make available to customers in the near future.


Finally, if you are not quite sure where to find what you are looking for you can just type a short query in the search bar at the top of each page.
