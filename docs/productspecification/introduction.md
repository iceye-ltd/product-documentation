With appropriate tasking priority, service level, and catalog privacy options, ICEYE effectively addresses a wide range of business needs and operational scenarios. 


## 1.4 Satellites and Sensors

The **ICEYE global imaging service** uses an innovative satellite and sensor design based on advancements in small satellite technologies and a proven, nimble NewSpace approach. The ICEYE fleet comprises two generations of satellites, with Generation 3 offering enhanced imaging capabilities compared to the earlier Generation 2. All ICEYE satellites currently operate in Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO). The constellation is continually evolving, optimized for persistent monitoring, ensuring fast and repeatable access to any location on Earth.

The ICEYE X-band radar **sensors** are based on an active phased array antenna which allows for precise electronic radar beam steering. When integrated with a highly agile satellite platform, this technology delivers exceptional imaging versatility, offering a range of products from broad, coarse-resolution images to highly detailed, high-definition outputs concentrated on smaller areas.

Table [1-1](#table-1-1-specifications-of-iceye-satellites-by-generation) provides a comparative overview between ICEYE Generation 2 and Generation 3 satellites and sensors focusing on imaging resolution (ground, slant range and azimuth), SAR pulse bandwidth, and communication link characteristics (carrier frequency and downlink speed). Moreover, the available imaging modes for the two generations are listed. Note that the imaging modes mentioned in the table are summarized in Section [1.5](#15-overview-of-imaging-modes) and described in Section [2](imagingmodes.md#2-iamaspaceimaging-modes-1).

Please note that in Table [1-1](#table-1-1-specifications-of-iceye-satellites-by-generation-1), the **Ground Resolutions** are represented as half the **Slant Range Resolutions.** This ratio exists because the SAR image data is collected by the sensor in the slant plane (the line-of-sight distance from the radar antenna to the target on the ground) but, in order to calculate ground resolution, it needs to be projected onto the ground plane using an Earth ellipsoid model (see Section [5.2.2](dataproducts.md#522-ground-range-detected-grd-image)). The slant range resolution is reduced by a factor of 1/sin(incidence angle). ICEYE utilizes an incidence angle of 30 degrees to define nominal ground resolutions for its highest resolution imaging modes.  1/sin(30°) = 2.


## 1.5 Overview of Imaging Modes

ICEYE currently provides a total of nine SAR **Imaging Modes**. Each of the modes leverages one of the following three SAR data **Collection Strategies**:

1. **Spotlight**. In the spotlight collection strategy the radar beam illuminates a fixed point for an extended period of time. This increases the illumination time and also increases the effective length of the synthetic aperture, improving the azimuth resolution. ICEYE offers six imaging modes based on this collection strategy optimizing different objectives (scene size, high resolution, low speckle, detection of movement and human-made objects). These six modes are Spot, Spot Fine, Spot Extended Area (SLEA), Dwell, Dwell Fine and Dwell Precise. These modes offer the finest resolution and image quality and are the best choice for object identification, detailed monitoring and change detection.

2. **Stripmap**. In the Stripmap collection strategy the ground swath is illuminated with a continuous sequence of pulses while the antenna beam is fixed in its orientation. The beam is pointed off to the side of the satellite at an angle broadside to the satellite flight path. This results in a long image strip parallel to the flight direction. ICEYE offers one imaging mode, Strip, based on this collection strategy. Multiple Strip image frames can be collected in succession.  Strip is ideal for applications for which resolution must be balanced with collection area.  These use cases include detecting changes in large sea and land areas, characterization of natural disasters and illegal activities, as well as persistent monitoring of border and coastal areas

3. **ScanSAR**. In the ScanSAR collection strategy the satellite’s phased array antenna generates multiple radar beams in the range direction. This illuminates a wide area via multiple adjacent strips. However, because individual points on the ground are illuminated for a shorter duration, the trade-off is reduced resolution in exchange for a significantly larger scene size. ICEYE employs a refined version of this collection strategy known as TOPSAR, which additionally electronically steers the beam from backward to forward in the azimuth direction. This ensures consistent image quality across the captured area. ICEYE offers two imaging modes, Scan and Scan Wide, based on this strategy. Both are ideal for wide area surveillance and monitoring, for example large area maritime search, monitoring of vessels, detection of oil spills and enforcement of exclusive economic zones.  

All nine imaging modes are listed in Table [1-2](#table-1-2-overview-of-the-iceye-imaging-modes) along with nominal ground resolution and scene size as well as the number of azimuth looks used in the image formation. Each imaging mode is a product with an accompanying specification, and henceforth this document will refer to these modes by their product name. The columns are explained further below. Moreover, Figure [1-1](#figure-1-1-an-illustration-of-the-relative-scene-size-areas-of-standard-iceye-imaging-modes-note-that-both-scan-and-strip-modes-can-be-extended-to-as-much-as-840-km-in-length-in-the-ground-track-direction-as-custom-orders-resolution-values-are-ground-projected) provides an illustration of the relative surface areas of the different ICEYE imaging modes.

ICEYE also offers 1-look and 2-looks variants of the imaging mode Spot Fine. These are intended for applications that require high resolution, but where lower information density is sufficient. Please refer to section [2.2](imagingmodes.md#22-spot-and-spot-fine) for more information.

The **Scene Dimensions** column describes the lengths of the range (the dimension perpendicular to the satellite's orbit path), and the azimuth (the dimension parallel to the orbit path), which together describe the surface area of the scene size (the rectangle on the Earth's ground plane that is imaged), with each imaging mode.

The **Ground Resolution** column describes the achievable resolution measured at the center of the scene of amplitude data products (section [5.2](dataproducts.md#52-amplitude-data-products)) that are projected to the ground.  

The **Number of Looks** refers to the number of independent sub-apertures (looks) that are spatially averaged to minimize speckle noise.  Increasing the number of looks effectively reduces speckle, resulting in cleaner and more interpretable data products.  In the context of SAR data analysis, reducing speckle is often as critical as achieving high resolution, particularly when performing tasks such as object classification and component-level identification.

The **Section Reference** column provides links to the relevant subsections of Section [2](imagingmodes.md#2-iamaspaceimaging-modes-3) where each corresponding imaging mode is thoroughly described and the related tasking parameters and performance characteristics and other attributes are tabulated.

As shown in Table [1-2](#table-1-2-overview-of-the-iceye-imaging-modes), there is a trade-off between scene size, image resolution and quality, and the appropriate imaging mode should be chosen after prioritization of imaging requirements. The adaptable design of ICEYE satellites allows for a continuous evolution of imaging mode offerings. Furthermore, ICEYE can support imaging that varies relative to the standard products summarized in Table [1-2](#table-1-2-overview-of-the-iceye-imaging-modes-2), such as extended scene sizes. Please refer to Section [3.1](tasking.md#31-standard-and-custom-orders) for more information about **Custom Orders** and contact ICEYE customer service via [the ICEYE website](https://www.iceye.com/contact/).


##### _Figure 1-1: An illustration of the relative scene size areas of standard ICEYE imaging modes.  Note that both Scan and Strip modes can be extended to as much as 500 km in length in the ground track direction as custom orders. Scan Wide can be extended to as much as 660 km in length in the ground track direction as custom orders.

## 1.6 Overview of Service Levels

The **Service Levels** supported by ICEYE depend on choices made by the customer during ordering. Two tasking options have the highest impact on the Service Level: the Tasking Priority Option (Commercial vs Background), and the Delivery Time Option (8 h vs 3 h). These two tasking options and their impact on Service Level are summarized in Table [1-3](#table-1-3-summary-of-the-options-that-determine-the-service-levels-for-standard-products).


##### _Table 1-3: Summary of the options that determine the service levels for standard products._

| Tasking Priority Option (Section [3.3](#34-tasking-priority-options))   | Commercial | Task prioritization is based on First In, First Out (FIFO):  the first task to claim a collection opportunity enjoys priority for that collection opportunity.  Commercial priority collections enjoy statistical likelihood of successful collection exceeding 90% (80% for the Scan Wide imaging mode). Note that the actual time of the collection may change within the desired collection window.                                                              |
|  Tasking Priority Option (Section [3.3](#34-tasking-priority-options))    | Background | Task prioritization is based on “space available” and subject to being overridden by Commercial priority collections (above).  Background tasking is a cost-effective method of tasking collections that are not required to be completed by a specific time.  Background tasking completion rates are dependent on the AOI of interest:  very high demand AOIs will likely have few opportunities for Background collections. |
| Delivery Time Option(Section [3.6.3](#373-delivery-time-service-level)) | 3 hour     | Data is delivered within 3 hours from the time of  acquisition.  Only available for Commercial Tasking Priority.  |
|  Delivery Time Option(Section [3.6.3](#373-delivery-time-service-level))        | 8 hour     |       Data is delivered within 8 hours from the time of  acquisition.  Only available for Commercial Tasking Priority.  |
|  Delivery Time Option(Section [3.6.3](#373-delivery-time-service-level))        | 24 hour     |       Data is delivered within 24 hours from the time of  acquisition.  Only available for Background Tasking Priority.  |

Commercial tasking priority is available in either a 3-hour or an 8-hour delivery time option. Background tasking priority is only available in a 24-hour delivery time option.

Note that as this section only offers a summary, customers are advised to refer to Section [3](#3-tasking-1) to understand these and other options in more detail. Together with the performance characteristics and product attributes of the imaging modes described in Section [2](imagingmodes.md#2-iamaspaceimaging-modes-4), and the data products described in Section [5](#5-data-products-1), these service levels define ICEYE tasking offering for **Standard Orders**.

ICEYE can also support non-standard requirements, including delivery service levels not shown in Table [1-3](#table-1-3-summary-of-the-options-that-determine-the-service-levels-for-standard-products). ICEYE considers requirements falling outside this standard framework as **Custom Orders** (See Section [3.1](tasking.md#31-standard-and-custom-orders-1)). Custom order requirements will be governed by specific contract terms agreed on a case by case basis. Please contact ICEYE to discuss requirements for custom orders.

## 1.7 Overview of Data Products 

ICEYE Data Products can be separated into two groups: **Amplitude Data Products** and **Complex Data Products**. The two data product offerings are introduced in Table [1-4](#table-1-4-introduction-to-iceyes-amplitude-data-products) and [1-6](#table-1-6-introduction-to-iceyes-complex-data-products), respectively. These tables briefly describe what the different data products are, their characteristics, file formats and special features. Links to the subsections of Section [5](dataproducts.md#5-data-products-2) are also provided to make it faster to find more information about each product. The service level and imaging mode support for each data product is described in Table [1-5](#table-1-5-amplitude-data-products-and-their-service-level-and-imaging-mode-support) and [1-7](#table-1-7-complex-data-products-and-their-service-level-and-imaging-mode-support) for amplitude and complex data products respectively. Note that the Custom service level is given for the Sensor Independent Complex Data (SICD) + Sensor Independent Derived Data(SIDD) and Compensated Phased History Data (CPHD) data products. These industry products are not part of ICEYE standard product offering, but can be provided by special request. As this section merely represents a summary, customers are advised to refer to Section [5](#5-data-products-3) for more information. See section references in the third column of Table [1-4](#table-1-4-introduction-to-iceyes-amplitude-data-products).
