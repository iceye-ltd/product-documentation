# 4. Catalog

## 4.1 ICEYE Archive Imagery

All ICEYE customers have access via their SFTP accounts to a complete catalog of archive imagery that is available for ordering.

This catalog is updated on a regular basis and is available in KMZ and GeoJSON formats. It includes low resolution image thumbnail images allowing customers to get a preview of the contents of the images. The archive catalog can be viewed in Google Earth, QGIS and other popular geoinformatics software (GIS) where customers can browse image locations, filter by time or basic image metadata to perform searches.

Please note that it takes at least 14 days for newly acquired imagery to become available via the ICEYE Archive Catalog.


## 4.2 Archive Imagery: How to Order

**Archive Imagery Orders** can be submitted via email. To place an order, customers must fill out the Order Form with their contact information, and include a list of the product names for the scenes to be purchased.

Once an order is received, the ICEYE Customer Success team will deliver the requested images **within 12 hours** assuming an ordinary order size (less than 50 archive images). Please note that orders for archive imagery include no final confirmation step.

Please note that orders for archive imagery do not go through additional quality control as they have already been processed during initial acquisition. However, customers with concerns about a defective image are invited to contact ICEYE’s COSP organization  in accordance with Section [3.6.1](tasking.md#361-return-policy) (Return Policy) above for consultation and potential remedy.
