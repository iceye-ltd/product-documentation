## Structure

* Where are all the 'levels' ?
* Foundations :
    * How is SAR Data formed?
    * Important stuff :
        * Radiometric Accuracy and Calibration
        * Spatial Accuracy
            * Resolution
            * Geolocation
                * Doppler Centroid Parameters
                * Rational Polynomial Coefficients
        * Slant to Ground conversion
